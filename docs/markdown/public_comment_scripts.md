## SCRIPT 1: The Incomplete Application

**Topic**: IRB Application Deficiencies  
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Audience**: County Commissioners  

### Script

"Good evening, Commissioners. My name is [NAME] and I'm a resident of [LOCATION].

On September 19, 2025, four of you voted to approve Ordinance 367-2025, authorizing $165 billion in Industrial Revenue Bonds for Project Jupiter—the largest IRB in New Mexico history.

According to the legal complaint filed on October 17, 2025, the IRB application contained 'blank and missing pages' and lacked critical information required by statute.

**Let me be clear**: You approved $165 BILLION in bonds based on an incomplete application.

New Mexico statute NMSA 1978, Section 3-32-6 requires complete applications with financial projections, job creation data, and economic benefit analysis. Where was that information when you voted?

County Counsel told you that jobs and revenue projections weren't required to be 'specified in the application.' But if they're not in the application, how did you verify the project's claims?

**My questions**:

1. Commissioner Schaljo-Hernandez, did you personally review the IRB application before voting YES? Can you identify what specific pages were blank or missing?

2. Commissioner Gameros, what due diligence did county staff perform to verify the financial projections before you approved $165 billion?

3. Commissioner Reynolds, were you aware that the application was incomplete when you voted YES?

4. Commissioner Sanchez, do you believe it's appropriate to approve the largest bond in state history based on an application with missing information?

I'll wait for your answers."

## SCRIPT 2: Open Meetings Act Violations

**Topic**: Transparency and Public Participation  
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Audience**: County Commissioners  

### Script

"Good evening. My name is [NAME], and I'm here to address what appears to be a violation of New Mexico's Open Meetings Act.

According to court documents and news reports, county officials signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with BorderPlex Digital and held private meetings months before the first public hearing.

On September 17, 2025—just TWO DAYS before your September 19 vote—you finally released the signed agreements to the public. Two days. To review documents for a $165 billion project.

The New Mexico Open Meetings Act, NMSA Section 10-15-1, requires that public business be conducted openly, with reasonable notice and opportunity for public review.

Mayor Javier Perea of Sunland Park said he was 'finding out information the same time as press releases.' If an elected mayor didn't have advance notice, what chance did ordinary citizens have?

When journalist Heath Haussamen requested records under IPRA, the county claimed the request was 'overly broad'—but the documents were already compiled in a single email. A commissioner had to leak them.

**This is not transparency. This is obstruction.**

**My questions**:

1. Who authorized the Non-Disclosure Agreement with BorderPlex Digital, and when was it signed?

2. How many private meetings were held with developers before the first public hearing? Who attended?

3. Why were final documents released only 2 days before the vote instead of the standard 10-14 days for major decisions?

4. Do any of you believe this process met the spirit—or the letter—of the Open Meetings Act?

Violations of the Open Meetings Act are criminal misdemeanors. The District Attorney should investigate."

## SCRIPT 3: Water—Where's the Study?

**Topic**: Water Usage and Aquifer Impact  
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Audience**: County Commissioners  

### Script

"Good evening, Commissioners. My name is [NAME], and I want to talk about water.

Project Jupiter's lease documents state that the data center will use 'closed-loop cooling' with an average of 20,000 gallons per day and a peak of 60,000 gallons per day.

But those numbers appear only in the 'recitals' section of the lease—descriptive statements, not binding covenants. There's no enforcement mechanism. No monitoring requirement. No penalty for exceeding the cap.

More importantly: Where is the aquifer impact study?

The Mesilla Basin is already water-stressed. On August 19, 2025, community members protested with signs saying 'You Can't Drink Data.' They're right. Data centers consume water. People need water.

The county has disclosed NO analysis of how this project affects our groundwater. The Governor's MOU commits the state to subsidize brackish water drilling—public funds for private water use—but where's the public benefit analysis?

**My questions**:

1. Did the county commission an independent hydrological study before approving this project? If so, where is it? If not, why not?

2. Who will monitor water usage to ensure compliance with the 60,000 gallon/day cap? What happens if they exceed it?

3. What happens to our community's water supply if this project uses more water than projected? Who bears that cost?

4. Commissioner Chaparro voted NO on this project. Commissioners Schaljo-Hernandez, Gameros, Reynolds, and Sanchez voted YES. Can the four of you explain why you voted to approve a project with no water impact study?

Our aquifer is not infinite. Our community's water is not negotiable. You owe us answers."

## SCRIPT 4: The Tax Giveaway

**Topic**: Property Tax Abatement and PILOT  
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Audience**: County Commissioners  

### Script

"Good evening. My name is [NAME], and I'd like to talk about money—specifically, the money you gave away.

On September 19, 2025, you approved a 100% property tax abatement for Project Jupiter for 30 years. In exchange, the county receives a fixed 'Payment in Lieu of Taxes'—or PILOT—of $12 million per year.

That sounds like a lot. Until you do the math.

Over 30 years, that's $360 million. But property taxes on a $50 BILLION project—with equipment refreshes over 30 years potentially reaching $165 billion—would be worth BILLIONS, not millions.

You gave away the difference. Billions in foregone revenue. Gone.

And here's the kicker: The MOU says the PILOT provides a 'stable, predictable revenue stream.' But property taxes ALSO provide stable, predictable revenue—and they're tied to actual assessed value, not a negotiated flat rate.

The county had NO economic impact analysis when you voted. No independent financial advisor reviewed the deal. No comparison of PILOT versus actual property tax revenue over 30 years.

You just...gave it away.

**My questions**:

1. What is the projected property tax revenue from this project over 30 years WITHOUT the abatement? Do you even know?

2. Did any independent financial analyst advise you that the PILOT was a better deal for taxpayers than property taxes? If so, where's the analysis?

3. Who negotiated the $12 million/year PILOT amount? Was that number based on comparable projects, or did BorderPlex just propose it and you accepted?

4. If this project fails and the developer walks away in year 5, what happens? Do taxpayers get stuck with the infrastructure costs and no revenue?

You work for us—the taxpayers. Show us the math."

## SCRIPT 5: Commissioner Reynolds—Doxxing and Accountability

**Topic**: Ethics and Intimidation  
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Audience**: County Commissioners  

### Script

"Good evening, Commissioners. My name is [NAME], and I want to address Commissioner Shannon Reynolds directly.

On September 5, 2025, you posted the names and addresses of residents who spoke out against Project Jupiter on your Facebook page. You doxxed your own constituents for exercising their First Amendment right to comment at a public meeting.

The New Mexico Environmental Law Center filed a formal complaint on September 8, 2025, demanding the county take action. What action did the county take? None that I'm aware of.

Commissioner Reynolds, those residents trusted that speaking at a public meeting was safe. You violated that trust. You used your position to intimidate people who disagreed with you.

And then, on September 19, you voted YES on Ordinance 367-2025. You voted YES on Ordinance 368-2025. And on October 14, you voted YES again on Ordinance 369-2025.

**Four times, you sided with the developers. Zero times did you apologize to the people you doxxed.**

This is not leadership. This is retaliation.

**My questions**:

1. Commissioner Reynolds, do you stand by your decision to post residents' names and addresses publicly?

2. Have you apologized to the residents you doxxed?

3. Do you believe it's appropriate for an elected official to retaliate against constituents who disagree with you?

4. To the other commissioners: Do you condone Commissioner Reynolds' actions? Will you censure her? Or are you willing to let this behavior become the norm?

Intimidation has no place in our democracy. Commissioner Reynolds, you owe this community an apology—and your resignation."

## SCRIPT 6: Natural Gas Is Not Zero Carbon

**Topic**: Environmental Misrepresentation  
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Audience**: County Commissioners (and Governor, if applicable)  

### Script

"Good evening. My name is [NAME], and I'm here to talk about a lie.

On February 25, 2025, Governor [NAME] signed a Memorandum of Understanding with BorderPlex Digital Assets that states—and I quote—that 'electricity generated from natural gas...may also qualify as a zero carbon resource.'

This is false.

Natural gas is methane. When you burn methane, it produces carbon dioxide. CO2. That's not zero carbon. That's carbon.

New Mexico's HB93 requires that by 2045, all power from qualified microgrids must come from net zero carbon resources. Net zero means actual emissions reductions, not accounting tricks.

The county's MOU with Project Jupiter acknowledges HB93's requirement. So which is it? Is natural gas zero carbon, as the state claims? Or does the project have to achieve net zero carbon by 2045, as state law requires?

You can't have it both ways.

This matters because Project Jupiter plans to power itself with a microgrid that includes natural gas generation. If natural gas is 'zero carbon,' they never have to transition to renewables. If it's not, they're in violation of state law.

**My questions**:

1. Do any of you believe natural gas is a 'zero carbon resource'? If so, on what scientific basis?

2. Did county staff review HB93's requirements before approving this project? If so, did they flag the contradiction with the state's MOU?

3. What happens if Project Jupiter fails to achieve net zero carbon by 2045? Is there a penalty? Or is this just aspirational language with no enforcement?

4. Will you commit, today, to requiring independent verification of the project's carbon emissions annually?

Our climate goals are not negotiable. Our laws are not optional. Hold this project accountable."

## FOLLOW-UP QUESTION GUIDE

**If commissioners claim they've "addressed" concerns**:
- "Where is the public record of that response? Can you provide the document number and date?"

**If commissioners say "this is still being reviewed"**:
- "You already voted. You approved $165 billion. The time for review was BEFORE the vote, not after."

**If commissioners defer to staff**:
- "You are the elected officials. You cast the vote. Staff works for you, not the other way around. Are you saying you voted without understanding the project?"

**If commissioners claim "confidentiality"**:
- "The Open Meetings Act prohibits secret deliberations on public business. Confidentiality is not a shield for avoiding accountability."

**If commissioners dismiss concerns as "fear-mongering"**:
- "These are documented facts from legal filings and your own MOU. Which specific fact do you dispute?"

**If commissioners say "we followed the law"**:
- "That's exactly what the lawsuit alleges you didn't do. Will you welcome a judicial review to prove your compliance?"

## TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE DELIVERY

1. **Time yourself**: Practice to stay under 2 minutes. Use a timer.
2. **Speak clearly**: Slow down. Pause after questions.
3. **Make eye contact**: Address commissioners directly, especially those who voted YES.
4. **Stay calm**: Anger is understandable, but clarity is more effective.
5. **Record yourself**: Many meetings are recorded, but bring your own backup recording.
6. **Bring printed sources**: Have citations printed and ready to submit as public record.
7. **Follow up in writing**: Submit your comments and questions via email after the meeting.
8. **Invite media**: Contact local journalists beforehand. Live-tweeting is powerful.
