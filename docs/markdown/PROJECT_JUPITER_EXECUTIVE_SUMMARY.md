## Executive Summary for Officials and Media

**Prepared:** January 22, 2026  
**Location:** El Paso, TX & Santa Teresa/Sunland Park, NM  
**Project:** Project Jupiter - $165 Billion Data Center Complex

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Project Jupiter is a $165 billion hyperscale data center complex proposed for Santa Teresa, New Mexico, that poses severe threats to the health, safety, and economic wellbeing of predominantly Hispanic, low-income communities in Santa Teresa and Sunland Park, NM, and neighboring El Paso, TX. 

**A lawsuit was filed on October 17, 2025** by the New Mexico Environmental Law Center on behalf of community residents and organizations, challenging the unlawful approval of this project by the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners.

---

## CRITICAL FACTS

### The Project
- **$165 BILLION** in Industrial Revenue Bonds approved
- **Hyperscale data center complex** with natural gas power plants, microgrid, battery storage, and desalination plant
- Led by STACK Infrastructure and BorderPlex Digital Assets, LLC
- Approved in **4-1 vote on September 19, 2025** despite massive community opposition

### The Community at Risk
- **91% Hispanic population**
- **52% low-income residents**
- Communities of Santa Teresa and Sunland Park, NM; adjacent to El Paso, TX
- **Already suffering from contaminated water** - arsenic levels above federal safety limits
- **Decades of inadequate infrastructure** and environmental burdens

---

## WHY PROJECT JUPITER MUST BE STOPPED

### 1. LEGAL VIOLATIONS - Unlawful Approval Process

**The Evidence:**
- County Commissioners approved project based on **incomplete application with blank and missing pages**
- **No environmental impact assessment** conducted
- **No economic impact analysis** provided to public
- **Closed-door meetings** between county officials and developers, including Non-Disclosure Agreements signed months before public notification
- Community residents "remained largely unaware of the proposed project up until days before the Board's decision"

**The Law Violated:**
State and local law requires county commissioners to make fully-informed decisions based on complete information. The approval was unlawful and procedurally deficient.

---

### 2. WATER CRISIS - Community Already Lacks Safe Drinking Water

**Current Conditions:**
- Santa Teresa and Sunland Park have **lacked access to clean, safe, affordable drinking water for decades**
- **Arsenic contamination** above federal health standards in current water supply
- EPA inspection (2025) revealed:
  - **3 of 4 arsenic treatment plants offline and bypassed** for over a year
  - Widespread neglect and disrepair of water utility facilities
  - Unsafe drinking water being delivered to homes

**Project Jupiter's Impact:**
- Data centers require **massive water consumption** for cooling operations
- Project includes desalination plant - indicating enormous water demand
- Will place **immense additional strain** on already failing water infrastructure
- **Communities cannot survive** further depletion of water resources

**Resident Testimony:**
> "We filed this lawsuit because the community's health is in danger. I'm protecting water rights for the community. Why would commissioners approve Project Jupiter without having all the documents? **How can we live without water? Water is life.**"  
> — José Saldaña Jr., Sunland Park resident

---

### 3. AIR POLLUTION - Natural Gas Power Plants

**The Threat:**
Project Jupiter requires massive electricity generation, necessitating:
- **Natural gas microgrid power plants**:
  - West Microgrid: 4.1 miles southwest of Santa Teresa
  - East Microgrid: 3.6 miles south of Santa Teresa
- Air pollution permit applications filed with NM Environment Department by Acoma, LLC

**Community Impact:**
- Increased air, noise, light, water, and soil pollution
- **Health hazards** for residents already bearing disproportionate environmental burdens
- No adequate health impact assessment conducted

---

### 4. INTIMIDATION OF RESIDENTS

**The Incident:**
On **September 5, 2025**, Doña Ana County Commissioner Shannon Reynolds:
- **Publicly exposed** on Facebook the name, home address, and email address of a resident opposing Project Jupiter
- Posted a lengthy list of names of residents who submitted public comments opposing the project
- Clear attempt to **intimidate and silence community opposition**

**NMELC Response:**
Sent formal demand letter stating this "gross misconduct" violates constitutional rights of community members to participate in public forums without fear of retaliation, harassment, or safety threats from elected officials.

---

### 5. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE VIOLATION

**The Pattern:**
- **91% Hispanic, 52% low-income community**
- Already suffering from:
  - Contaminated drinking water (arsenic)
  - Failed water infrastructure
  - Inadequate public services
  - Decades of environmental neglect

**New Burden:**
Project Jupiter adds:
- Massive water consumption
- Air pollution from power plants
- Strain on electricity grid
- Increased living costs (water rates, electricity rates)
- Health and safety risks

**This is Environmental Racism:**
Vulnerable minority community forced to bear environmental harms for private corporate profit, without meaningful community consent or adequate environmental protections.

---

### 6. ECONOMIC HARM TO RESIDENTS

**Tax Issues:**
- **$165 billion in Industrial Revenue Bonds** with Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) structure
- **Reduces county property tax revenue** that would normally fund public services
- **LEDA funding approved** to pay Project Jupiter permit fees - taxpayer money supporting private development

**Community Costs:**
- Increased water rates (already high, water contaminated)
- Increased electricity rates (strain on grid)
- Infrastructure deterioration
- Health costs from pollution exposure
- No demonstrated benefit to local residents

**Missing Analysis:**
> "There's a missing economic analysis, there's a missing environmental analysis, and certainly, there's a missing community voice"  
> — Daisy Maldonado, Director, Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County

---

### 7. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

**Secret Dealings:**
- County staff and officials engaged in **closed-door meetings** with developers for months
- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** signed with Project Jupiter companies earlier in 2025
- Community kept in dark until days before approval vote

**Inadequate Public Notice:**
- Notices only posted online - communities have limited internet access
- No notices in Spanish despite 91% Hispanic population
- Physical locations in impacted communities not used for notification
- Even **Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea** stated: "We're finding out information at the same time that press releases are being released"

**Result:**
> "Our voices were still not heard"  
> — Vivian Fuller, Santa Teresa resident

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR EL PASO

While Project Jupiter is located in Doña Ana County, NM, its impacts directly affect El Paso, TX:

1. **Shared Water Resources:** Rio Grande aquifer serves both regions
2. **Air Quality:** Pollution from microgrid power plants crosses state lines
3. **Electricity Grid:** Regional grid strain affects all borderland communities
4. **Economic Precedent:** Sets dangerous precedent for similar projects in El Paso area
5. **Community Connection:** Santa Teresa/Sunland Park residents are part of greater El Paso borderland community

**El Paso residents have a stake in opposing Project Jupiter.**

## BOTTOM LINE

**Project Jupiter is unlawfully approved, environmentally destructive, and fundamentally unjust.**

A predominantly Hispanic, low-income community already suffering from contaminated water and failed infrastructure is being forced to accept a $165 billion project that will:
- **Deplete scarce water resources** in a community that already lacks safe drinking water
- **Pollute the air** with natural gas power plants
- **Provide no meaningful benefit** to local residents
- **Enrich private corporations** at the expense of public health and safety

**The approval was rushed, secretive, and based on incomplete information.**

County officials violated the law, silenced community voices, and even intimidated residents who dared to oppose the project.

**This must be stopped.**

The lawsuit provides a legal path to overturn the unlawful approval. Community organizing, media attention, and political pressure can ensure Project Jupiter never breaks ground.

**Water is life. The community's health is in danger. We must act now.**
