- **No EIA conducted** before county approval
- **No assessment of:**
  - Water resource impacts
  - Air quality impacts
  - Noise and light pollution
  - Soil and groundwater contamination risks
  - Cumulative environmental impacts
  - Environmental justice implications

**Quote - Daisy Maldonado:**
> "There's a missing economic analysis, there's a missing environmental analysis, and certainly, there's a missing community voice"

**Structure:**
- Series 2025A: [specific amount in bond documents]
- Series 2025B: [specific amount in bond documents]
- Series 2025C: [specific amount in bond documents]

**Payment Structure:** Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)
- Replaces standard property tax revenue
- Typically results in reduced county tax revenue
- Benefits private corporation at expense of public services funding

**Bond Documents (Complete Set):**
- Bond Purchase Agreement - Series 2025A
- Bond Purchase Agreement - Series 2025B
- Bond Purchase Agreement - Series 2025C
- Indenture of Trust documents
- Lease Agreement documents
- Sub-sublease agreements
- All documents with executed/recorded versions

**Location:** `datacenter_research/documents/data-centers/` directory (14 PDF files)

### LEDA Funding

**Local Economic Development Act (LEDA):**
- Two ordinances approved to support Project Jupiter
- Includes GRT (Gross Receipts Tax) sharing agreement
- County funds committed to pay anticipated permit fees for private project

**Documents:**
- `LEDA-PPA-GRT-Share_Executed.pdf` (1.0 MB)
- `9.19.25.JupiterIRBOrdinance.pdf` (1.6 MB)
- Related ordinance execution documents

### Missing Economic Impact Analysis

**Standard Practice:** Major economic development projects require comprehensive economic impact analysis before approval

**Analysis Should Include:**
- Job creation projections (number, type, wage levels)
- Tax revenue impacts (gains vs. losses)
- Infrastructure costs to county/taxpayers
- Cost-benefit analysis for local residents
- Impact on existing businesses and housing markets
- Long-term fiscal sustainability

**Project Jupiter Status:**
- **No economic impact analysis conducted or provided to public**
- **No documentation of community benefits**
- **No assessment of costs to taxpayers**

**Quote - Daisy Maldonado:**
> "There's a missing economic analysis, there's a missing environmental analysis, and certainly, there's a missing community voice"

### Community Economic Burden

**Costs to Residents:**
1. **Higher water rates:** Increased demand drives up prices for scarce resource
2. **Higher electricity rates:** Grid strain and infrastructure costs passed to consumers
3. **Reduced public services:** Lost tax revenue from PILOT structure
4. **Infrastructure deterioration:** Strain on roads, utilities, emergency services
5. **Health costs:** Medical expenses from pollution-related illnesses
6. **Property value impacts:** Potential devaluation from industrial pollution proximity

**No Documented Benefits for Community:**
- Job creation claims unverified
- Wage levels not specified
- Local hiring commitments absent
- Community benefit agreements not negotiated

---

## 6. PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS

### Closed-Door Meetings & Non-Disclosure Agreements

**Timeline:** County officials engaged in secret negotiations for months before public notification

**Evidence:**
- County staff and officials had "discussions and closed-door meetings with the project developers months in advance"
- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** entered into with Project Jupiter companies "earlier this year" (2025)
- Community "remained largely unaware of the proposed project up until days before the Board's decision"

**Source:** Lawsuit documentation and press releases

**Procedural Violation:**
- Violates open meetings laws
- Denies community meaningful participation in decision-making
- Creates conflict of interest (county officials committed before public input)

**Document:**
- `2025.09.24_Project_Jupiter_Fully_Executed_MOU.pdf` (383 KB) - Memorandum of Understanding showing timeline of planning

### Rush to Approval

**Timeline:**
- **September 19, 2025:** First public hearing (described as "contentious")
- **September 19, 2025:** 4-1 vote approving IRB ordinance and first LEDA ordinance
- **October 14, 2025:** 4-1 vote approving second LEDA ordinance (permit fees)
- **October 17, 2025:** Lawsuit filed challenging unlawful approval

**Rushed Process Problems:**
- Minimal time between public notification and approval vote
- No time for independent expert review
- No opportunity for comprehensive public comment period
- Incomplete application accepted without requiring corrections

### Inadequate Public Engagement

**Standard Practice:** Major projects require extensive public engagement:
- Multiple public hearings
- Extended comment periods (typically 30-60 days minimum)
- Notices in multiple languages
- Accessible meeting times and locations
- Plain-language summaries of complex technical/financial documents

**Project Jupiter Process:**
- Minimal public notification
- Single contentious hearing with overwhelming opposition
- Immediate approval vote despite community concerns
- No translation services or Spanish-language materials
- Online-only notices (inaccessible to many community members)

### Local Government Opposition Ignored

**Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea:**
- Requested delay in approval to allow adequate review
- Stated local government officials were "finding out information at the same time that press releases are being released"
- Noted information provided "doesn't cover a lot of information"
- Request for delay was **denied** by County Commissioners

**Implication:** County ignored concerns even from local elected officials directly representing affected communities

---

## 7. COMMUNITY OPPOSITION DOCUMENTATION

### Public Hearing (September 19, 2025)

**Characterization:** "Contentious public hearing" with strong community protest

**Opposition Level:** Overwhelming majority of public comments opposed project

**Vote Result:** 4-1 approval despite community opposition

**Commissioner Votes:**
- **YES (4):** Commissioners voted to approve despite constituent opposition
- **NO (1):** Commissioner Susana Chaparro - "remaining steadfast in her commitment to Doña Ana County constituents"

### Direct Testimony from Plaintiffs

**José Saldaña Jr. (Sunland Park Resident):**
> "We filed this lawsuit because the community's health is in danger. I'm protecting water rights for the community. Why would commissioners approve Project Jupiter without having all the documents? How can we live without water? Water is life."

**Contact:** saldanajose21@yahoo.com | (915) 204-9720

**Vivian Fuller (Santa Teresa Resident):**
> "Our voices were still not heard"

## 8. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE EVIDENCE

### Community Demographics

**Santa Teresa and Sunland Park, NM:**
- **91% Hispanic population**
- **52% low-income residents**
- Predominantly working-class communities
- Many residents with limited English proficiency
- Limited access to internet and technology

**Source:** Multiple documents in datacenter_research directory citing these statistics

### Historical Environmental Burdens

**Existing Problems:**
1. **Contaminated drinking water** - arsenic above federal limits
2. **Failed water infrastructure** - treatment plants offline
3. **Inadequate public services** - decades of neglect
4. **Limited resources** - low-income community struggles with utility costs
5. **Language barriers** - Spanish-speaking population underserved by English-only processes

### Disproportionate Impact Pattern

**Environmental Justice Definition:** Disproportionate environmental burdens placed on minority and low-income communities

**Project Jupiter Fits Pattern:**
- Vulnerable community selected for harmful industrial project
- Community lacks political power to resist
- Economic incentives prioritized over community health
- Environmental harms externalized to residents
- Benefits (if any) accrue to outside corporations

### Lack of Meaningful Community Consent

**Environmental Justice Principle:** Affected communities must have meaningful participation in decisions impacting their health and environment

**Project Jupiter Violations:**
- Community kept in dark during planning (closed-door meetings, NDAs)
- Minimal time for public input before approval
- No Spanish-language materials for predominantly Hispanic community
- Incomplete information provided (blank pages, missing documents)
- Community opposition ignored (4-1 vote despite overwhelming protest)
- Intimidation tactics used against residents who spoke out (doxxing)

**Result:** **No meaningful community consent obtained**

### Cumulative Impact Concern

**Environmental Justice Analysis:** Must consider cumulative impacts of multiple environmental stressors

**Santa Teresa/Sunland Park Cumulative Burdens:**
1. Existing water contamination (arsenic)
2. Failed water infrastructure
3. **NEW:** Massive water depletion from data center
4. **NEW:** Air pollution from natural gas power plants
5. **NEW:** Noise and light pollution from industrial operations
6. **NEW:** Strain on electricity grid → higher rates
7. **NEW:** Health impacts from pollution exposure

**No Cumulative Impact Assessment Conducted**
