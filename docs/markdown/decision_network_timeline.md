### Communication Patterns and Red Flags

#### **Pattern 1: State Pre-Commitment**
**Timeline**: Feb 25 (State MOU) → Sept 19 (County vote)  
**Significance**: State committed 7 months before local approval  
**Implication**: State pressure on county to approve project already blessed at state level  

**Network**: Governor's Office → NMED/State Engineer/EDD → County (via political channels, not documented)

**Red Flag**: Did state officials pressure county commissioners? Phone logs and emails needed (IPRA request).

---

#### **Pattern 2: Private-to-Public Transition**
**Timeline**: Early 2025 (NDA + private meetings) → Sept 17 (document release) → Sept 19 (vote)  
**Significance**: Months of private negotiations, then 2-day public review  
**Implication**: Decision made privately, public process was theater  

**Network**: BorderPlex ↔ County Commissioners/Staff (NDA shield) → Public (controlled release)

**Red Flag**: Who attended private meetings? What was discussed? NDA prevents disclosure, but Open Meetings Act may void NDA for public officials conducting public business.

---

#### **Pattern 3: Coordinated 4-1 Voting Bloc**
**Timeline**: Sept 19 (2 YES votes) + Oct 14 (1 YES vote) = 3 identical 4-1 outcomes  
**Significance**: Four commissioners voted identically three times  
**Implication**: Either coordinated decision-making OR shared pressure/incentive  

**Network**: Schaljo-Hernandez + Gameros + Reynolds + Sanchez (voting bloc)

**Red Flag**: Did the four communicate outside public meetings to coordinate votes? If so, Open Meetings Act violation.

**Research Needed**: Text messages, emails, phone logs among the four commissioners (IPRA request).

---

#### **Pattern 4: Retaliation Against Opposition**
**Timeline**: Community protests → Reynolds doxxing (Sept 5) → YES votes (Sept 19, Oct 14)  
**Significance**: Reynolds targeted opponents, then voted for project they opposed  
**Implication**: Intimidation to suppress dissent + personal stake in project approval  

**Network**: Community opponents → Reynolds (hostile response) → BorderPlex (vote support)

**Red Flag**: Did Reynolds have undisclosed connections to BorderPlex or financial interest in project approval?

---

#### **Pattern 5: Document Version Control Issues**
**Timeline**: Oct 1 (initial docs, omissions) → Oct 12 (updated docs with water caps and $6.9M)  
**Significance**: Key commitments added or disclosed after vote  
**Implication**: Either post-vote document modification OR selective initial disclosure  

**Network**: County Staff/BorderPlex (document preparation) → Public (controlled release)

**Red Flag**: Were documents altered after Sept 19 vote? Who authorized changes? Forensic document analysis needed (metadata, version history).

---

#### **Pattern 6: Synchronization of Execution and Lawsuit**
**Timeline**: Oct 17 (lawsuit filed) = Oct 17 (Community Development Agreement signed)  
**Significance**: County executed another agreement on the same day lawsuit was filed  
**Implication**: Rush to finalize binding commitments despite legal challenge  

**Network**: County + BorderPlex (execution) | Plaintiffs (legal challenge)

**Red Flag**: Did county rush execution to create additional legal barriers to unwinding the deal?

---

### Participation in Executive Sessions

**Research Needed**: Review commission meeting agendas for executive sessions Feb-Oct 2025  
**Key Questions**:
- How many executive sessions were held during Project Jupiter timeline?
- What were the stated reasons (legal advice, real estate, personnel)?
- Were executive session minutes properly sealed and logged?
- Was BorderPlex discussed in executive sessions? (May be disclosable under IPRA if discussions exceeded legal justification)

**Method**: IPRA request for:
1. All executive session agendas and stated reasons (Feb-Oct 2025)
2. Certification that executive sessions complied with Open Meetings Act
3. Any executive session minutes related to "economic development" or "BorderPlex" or "Project Jupiter"

---

### Hiring Linkages

**Research Needed**: County employment records  
**Key Questions**:
- Were any county staff hired from BorderPlex or affiliated companies?
- Were any county staff hired to positions related to Project Jupiter after State MOU signed (Feb 25)?
- Were any consultants hired to work on Project Jupiter? Who selected them? What were their connections?

**Method**: IPRA request for:
1. All consultant contracts related to Project Jupiter or economic development (Jan 2025-present)
2. Employment records for county economic development staff (hires/promotions Feb 2025-present)
3. Resumes and hiring justifications for any positions created or filled during Project Jupiter timeline

**Red Flag to watch for**: "Revolving door" between BorderPlex/affiliates and county staff

---

### Announcement Timing

**Research Needed**: Compare announcement timing to other major news events  
**Hypothesis**: Were Project Jupiter announcements timed to minimize media attention?

**Method**: Media calendar analysis
- Sept 17 (Fri) document release → Sept 19 (Sun) vote = weekend timing, minimal news cycle coverage
- Check: Were other major local/state news events occurring Sept 17-19 that could distract media?

**Red Flag**: Strategic timing to avoid scrutiny

---

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. State Pre-Empted Local Control
The Governor's Feb 25 MOU created fait accompli pressure on county decision. State committed regulatory fast-tracking before county vote.

### 2. Closed-Door Decision-Making
NDA + private meetings + 2-day document release = Decision made privately, public process was formality.

### 3. Coordinated Voting Bloc
Four commissioners voted identically three times. Coordination suggests either shared agenda or shared pressure.

### 4. Retaliation Pattern
Reynolds doxxed opponents, then voted for project. Intimidation + support = evidence of personal stake or external pressure.

### 5. Document Control Issues
Version discrepancies and late releases suggest either post-vote modifications or strategic withholding of key terms.

### 6. Municipal Exclusion
Sunland Park Mayor excluded despite project proximity. County bypassed affected municipality's input.

---

## RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATIONS

### Legal
1. Open Meetings Act compliance review (executive sessions, NDA, private meetings)
2. Conflict of interest investigation (commissioners' financial ties to BorderPlex or affiliates)
3. Document forensics (metadata analysis of MOUs and leases to detect post-vote modifications)

### Records Requests (IPRA)
1. All communications (emails, texts, calls) between commissioners and BorderPlex (Jan-Oct 2025)
2. All executive session agendas and minutes (Feb-Oct 2025)
3. Consultant contracts and hiring records related to Project Jupiter
4. County Counsel's written legal advice on IRB application completeness

### Investigative Journalism
1. Interview County Manager Stephen Lopez (on record: Why no economic analysis?)
2. Interview Commissioner Chaparro (on record: Why did she vote NO?)
3. Background investigation of BorderPlex entities (corporate structure, beneficial ownership)
4. Campaign finance deep dive (all four YES voters + shared donors)
