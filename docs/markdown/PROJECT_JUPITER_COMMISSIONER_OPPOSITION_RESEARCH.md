## DISTRICT 1: CHRISTOPHER SCHALJO HERNANDEZ (CHAIR)

### Basic Information
- **Position:** District 1 Commissioner, Board Chair
- **District:** District 1 (likely includes parts of Las Cruces and surrounding areas - verify exact boundaries)
- **Contact:** Via Doña Ana County main number or BoCC@dona-ana.state.nm.us
- **Status:** Elected official; Chair position indicates leadership role and responsibility

### Project Jupiter Actions
- **Sept 19, 2025:** Voted YES on Ordinance 367 (IRB - $165B) and Ordinance 368 (LEDA GRT Share)
- **Oct 14, 2025:** Voted YES on Ordinance 369 (LEDA Building Permit Fees)
- **As Chair:** Would have presided over both meetings; responsible for setting agenda and managing public comment period

### Accountability Issues
1. **Leadership Responsibility:** As Board Chair, bears primary responsibility for:
   - Allowing votes to proceed despite incomplete application
   - Permitting approval without economic or environmental analysis
   - Not preventing or condemning Commissioner Reynolds' doxxing incident
   - Setting tone that enabled secretive process

2. **Failure to Delay:** Despite:
   - Community requests for more time (Daisy Maldonado, Empower NM)
   - City of Sunland Park official request for delay (Mayor Perea)
   - Missing critical information (economic analysis, environmental review)
   - Legal concerns raised by residents

3. **Procedural Failures:** As Chair, responsible for ensuring:
   - Complete applications before consideration (not enforced)
   - Adequate public notice and engagement (arguably failed)
   - Compliance with Open Meetings Act (violated with secret NDA meetings)
   - Fair public comment process (compromised by intimidation)

### Political Vulnerabilities
- **Chair Title = Higher Profile:** More visible than other commissioners; can't hide behind anonymity
- **Leadership Accountability:** Voters can argue "the buck stops here"
- **District Boundaries:** Need to identify key communities in District 1 affected by Jupiter

### Opposition Research Needs
- [ ] Campaign finance records: Did he receive contributions from tech industry, real estate developers, or entities connected to BorderPlex/STACK?
- [ ] Past votes: Does he have pattern of approving development projects without adequate review?
- [ ] Professional background: Any conflicts of interest (business ties to tech, real estate, energy)?
- [ ] Public statements: Has he made claims about Jupiter that can be fact-checked (job numbers, economic benefits)?
- [ ] Election history: Margin of victory in last election? Vulnerability for recall or next election?
- [ ] Social media: Posts supporting Jupiter? Interactions with developers? Corporate ties?

### Talking Points Against
- "Chair Schaljo Hernandez presided over the most corrupt approval process in county history"
- "As Chair, he had the power to delay the vote—he chose not to"
- "He allowed $165 billion to be approved based on an application with blank pages"
- "Leadership means protecting the public interest—he failed"

## DISTRICT 2: GLORIA GAMEROS

### Basic Information
- **Position:** District 2 Commissioner
- **District:** District 2 (verify boundaries - may include southern county areas)
- **Contact:** Via county main number or BoCC email
- **Status:** Elected official

### Project Jupiter Actions
- **Sept 19, 2025:** Voted YES on Ordinance 367 (IRB) and Ordinance 368 (LEDA GRT)
- **Oct 14, 2025:** Voted YES on Ordinance 369 (LEDA Building Permit Fees)
- **Public statements:** Unknown (research needed)

### Accountability Issues
1. **Voted YES Twice:** Double down on approval despite:
   - Intervening community opposition between Sept 19 and Oct 14
   - Lawsuit filing on Oct 17 (3 days after second vote)
   - Growing public awareness of problems with application

2. **Ignored Constituents:** If District 2 includes Sunland Park or Santa Teresa:
   - Direct betrayal of most-impacted communities
   - Voted against neighborhoods that will bear water/environmental burden

3. **Silent Complicity:** No public statements (that we've found) defending vote:
   - Suggests either shame about decision or indifference to public concern
   - Allows other commissioners to take heat while staying quiet

### Political Vulnerabilities
- **Low Profile = Less Scrutiny:** May be unprepared for targeted advocacy/accountability
- **Anonymity in Media:** Most news articles don't name her; can be framed as "hiding"
- **If District 2 Includes Impacted Areas:** Direct electoral vulnerability from angry constituents

### Opposition Research Needs
- [ ] District boundaries: Does District 2 include Sunland Park, Santa Teresa, or other directly affected areas?
- [ ] Electoral margins: Close race or safe seat?
- [ ] Campaign finance: Contributions from development interests?
- [ ] Past votes: Pattern of pro-development voting?
- [ ] Public statements on Jupiter: Any on record? Can be held accountable for claims?
- [ ] Community ties: Does she live in or near affected areas (makes betrayal more personal)?
- [ ] Professional background: Conflicts of interest?

### Talking Points Against
- "Commissioner Gameros voted YES twice—even after seeing community opposition"
- "She won't even defend her vote publicly"
- "Is she representing District 2 residents, or corporate interests?"
- "Silence isn't neutrality—it's complicity"

## DISTRICT 3: SHANNON REYNOLDS

### Basic Information
- **Position:** District 3 Commissioner
- **District:** District 3 (verify boundaries)
- **Contact:** Via county main number; active on Facebook (confirmed)
- **Status:** Elected official; MOST VULNERABLE due to doxxing incident

### Project Jupiter Actions
- **Sept 19, 2025:** Voted YES on Ordinance 367 (IRB) and Ordinance 368 (LEDA GRT)
- **Oct 14, 2025:** Voted YES on Ordinance 369 (LEDA Building Permit Fees)
- **Sept 5, 2025:** Posted names and home addresses of residents opposing Jupiter on Facebook

### Accountability Issues - EXTENSIVE

#### 1. DOXXING INCIDENT (Sept 5, 2025)
**What Happened:**
- Posted to Facebook: Name, home address, and email of at least one New Mexico resident opposing Jupiter
- Posted lengthy list of names of individuals (many Doña Ana County residents) who submitted written public comment in opposition
- Clear intent: Intimidation and retaliation

**Why This Matters:**
- **First Amendment Violation:** Retaliation against residents for exercising free speech rights
- **Abuse of Office:** Used position to access public comment records, then weaponized that access
- **Invasion of Privacy:** Exposed personal information that could endanger residents
- **Creating Chilling Effect:** Discourages future public participation (if you speak up, you'll be doxxed)
- **Potential Criminal Violation:** Depending on NM law, could constitute harassment, intimidation, or misuse of public records

**Official Response:**
- New Mexico Environmental Law Center sent formal letter on Sept 8, 2025 to:
  - Commissioner Shannon Reynolds
  - Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners
  - County Management
- NMELC demanded:
  - Immediate action to ensure misconduct doesn't happen again
  - Protection for community members participating in public forums
  - Guarantee against retaliation, harassment, and threats to safety

**Consequences for Reynolds:**
- NMELC stated: "We Will Defend the Constitutional Rights of Community Members to Submit Comments and Will Not Tolerate Intimidation Tactics"
- Created documented record of misconduct
- Establishes pattern of hostility toward Jupiter opponents

#### 2. Pattern of Pro-Jupiter Advocacy
- Voted YES twice despite overwhelming community opposition
- Doxxing indicates personal investment in Jupiter's approval (beyond normal commissioner duty)
- Suggests possible:
  - Financial interest (investigate)
  - Ideological commitment to development at any cost
  - Personal relationship with developers (investigate)

#### 3. Violation of Public Trust
- Commissioners are supposed to WELCOME public input, not punish it
- By doxxing opponents, she signaled: "If you oppose me, I will retaliate"
- Fundamental breach of democratic norms

### Political Vulnerabilities - SEVERE

1. **Documented Misconduct:** NMELC letter creates paper trail; can be used in:
   - Recall campaign
   - Ethics complaint
   - Civil lawsuit (by doxxed individuals)
   - Criminal complaint (potentially)
   - Opposition campaign materials

2. **Public Outrage:** Doxxing universally condemned; even Jupiter supporters may not defend it

3. **Legal Exposure:** Individuals who were doxxed could sue for:
   - Invasion of privacy
   - Intentional infliction of emotional distress
   - Civil rights violations (§1983 claim if acting under color of state law)
   - Injunctive relief

4. **Media Narrative:** "Commissioner who doxxed residents voted for $165B corporate giveaway" writes itself

5. **Recall Vulnerability:** If NM law allows recall of county commissioners, Reynolds is prime target

### Opposition Research Needs - PRIORITY
- [ ] **URGENT:** Obtain copy of actual Facebook post (screenshot, archive)
- [ ] Identify all individuals doxxed (potential plaintiffs in civil suit)
- [ ] Document any harm suffered (harassment, threats, need to move, emotional distress)
- [ ] Campaign finance: Contributions from BorderPlex, STACK, related entities, or tech industry?
- [ ] Professional ties: Does she work in tech, real estate, energy, or related field?
- [ ] Past misconduct: Other incidents of retaliation or abuse of office?
- [ ] Social media audit: Other problematic posts? Pattern of hostility toward residents?
- [ ] Relationships with developers: Personal or professional ties to BorderPlex, Lanham Napier, STACK Infrastructure?
- [ ] Property interests: Does she own land that would benefit from Jupiter (water infrastructure, road improvements, etc.)?
- [ ] NDA involvement: Was she personally involved in signing county NDA with developers?

### Legal Actions Available Against Reynolds
1. **Ethics Complaint:** File with NM Secretary of State or county ethics board (if exists)
2. **Civil Lawsuit:** Class action by all doxxed individuals
3. **Criminal Complaint:** Harassment, intimidation, or misuse of public records (consult NM criminal attorney)
4. **Recall Petition:** If allowed under NM law for county commissioners
5. **Federal Civil Rights Claim:** §1983 lawsuit for First Amendment retaliation
6. **Public Records Request:** IPRA request for:
   - All communications between Reynolds and developers
   - Records showing how she obtained doxxed individuals' information
   - Any complaints filed against her
   - County's response to NMELC letter

### Talking Points Against - REYNOLDS IS #1 TARGET
- "Commissioner Shannon Reynolds DOXXED residents for opposing Project Jupiter"
- "She posted our names and addresses on Facebook to intimidate us"
- "This is retaliation for exercising our First Amendment rights"
- "She abused her position to access our information, then weaponized it against us"
- "Then she voted YES on a $165 billion corporate giveaway"
- "This isn't public service—it's corruption and intimidation"
- "Shannon Reynolds must resign or be removed from office"
- **Campaign slogan:** "Reynolds Doxxed Residents, Then Sold Out Our County" #ResignReynolds

## DISTRICT 5: MANUEL A. SANCHEZ

### Basic Information
- **Position:** District 5 Commissioner
- **District:** District 5 (verify boundaries)
- **Contact:** Via county main number or BoCC email

- **Oct 14, 2025:** Voted YES on Ordinance 369 (LEDA Building Permit Fees)
- **Public statements:** Unknown (research needed)

### Accountability Issues
1. **Voted YES Twice:** Approved project despite:
   - Incomplete application (blank pages)
   - No economic analysis
   - No environmental review
   - Community opposition

2. **Silent on Reynolds Doxxing:** No public statement (found so far) condemning Reynolds' actions
   - Silence = tacit approval of intimidation tactics
   - Failure to defend constituents' right to public comment

3. **Ignored Legal Concerns:** Voted YES even though:
   - Project may not legally qualify for LEDA (statute requires "new jobs")
   - Secret meetings and NDA likely violated Open Meetings Act
   - Incomplete application violated county procedures

### Political Vulnerabilities
- **Low Profile:** Like Gameros, hasn't been publicly named/targeted (yet)
- **Anonymity = Hiding:** Can be framed as avoiding accountability
- **If District 5 Includes Rural/Agricultural Areas:** May be vulnerable to water usage argument

### Opposition Research Needs
- [ ] District boundaries: What communities are in District 5?
- [ ] Electoral history: Safe seat or competitive?
- [ ] Campaign finance: Development interests funding?
- [ ] Professional background: Conflicts of interest?
- [ ] Past votes: Pro-development pattern?
- [ ] Public statements: Anything on record about Jupiter?
- [ ] Community ties: Connections to affected areas?

### Talking Points Against
- "Commissioner Sanchez voted for $165 billion in corporate giveaways—twice"
- "He approved a project with blank pages in the application"
- "He stayed silent when Commissioner Reynolds doxxed residents"
- "Who does he represent—us or corporate developers?"

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: THE YES VOTERS

### Ranking by Vulnerability (Most to Least)

**1. Shannon Reynolds (District 3)** - MOST VULNERABLE
- **Why:** Doxxing incident = documented, indefensible misconduct
- **Attack Strategy:** Make her the face of corruption; demand resignation; pursue legal action
- **Goal:** Force resignation or removal; at minimum, make example to deter others

**2. Christopher Schaljo Hernandez (District 1)** - VULNERABLE AS CHAIR
- **Why:** Leadership position = higher accountability standard
- **Attack Strategy:** "The buck stops here" messaging; leadership failure frame
- **Goal:** Electoral defeat in next election; damage reputation

**3. Gloria Gameros (District 2)** - VULNERABLE IF DISTRICT AFFECTED
- **Why:** If District 2 includes Sunland Park/Santa Teresa, direct betrayal of constituents
- **Attack Strategy:** "She sold out her own neighbors" messaging; localized opposition
- **Goal:** Electoral defeat; make her defend vote publicly

**4. Manuel A. Sanchez (District 5)** - LEAST VULNERABLE (but still accountable)
- **Why:** Least information available; may represent less-affected district
- **Attack Strategy:** "He's hiding from accountability" frame; make him respond publicly
- **Goal:** Force into defensive position; weaken for next election

### Common Vulnerabilities (All Four)

1. **Approved Incomplete Application**
   - Indefensible: Blank pages admitted in lawsuit
   - Violates basic procedural requirements

2. **Ignored Community**
   - Sunland Park Mayor requested delay - ignored
   - Hundreds of residents opposed - ignored
   - Community organizations protested - ignored

3. **No Economic/Environmental Analysis**
   - Approved $165B without knowing costs/benefits
   - Violated due diligence

4. **Secret Process**
   - NDA with developers
   - Private meetings months before public hearings
   - Open Meetings Act violations

5. **Legal Violations**
   - Project may not qualify for LEDA under state law
   - Ordinances subject to lawsuit

6. **Voted Twice**
   - Second vote (Oct 14) came after growing opposition
   - Shows disregard for public input
   - Opportunity to correct mistake was rejected
