## WHAT IS PROJECT JUPITER?

A **$165 BILLION data center complex** proposed for Santa Teresa, New Mexico, that threatens the health and safety of borderland communities.

**Lawsuit Filed:** October 17, 2025 to overturn illegal approval

## WHY WE MUST STOP IT

###  **WATER CRISIS**
Our community ALREADY lacks safe drinking water:
-  Arsenic contamination above federal safety limits
-  3 of 4 water treatment plants offline for over a year
-  EPA found "widespread neglect" of water infrastructure
-  Data centers require MASSIVE water consumption
-  Project Jupiter will deplete our scarce water supply

> **"How can we live without water? Water is life."**  
> — José Saldaña Jr., Sunland Park resident

---

###  **ILLEGAL APPROVAL**
County Commissioners broke the law:
-  Approved based on incomplete application with BLANK PAGES
-  NO environmental impact assessment
-  NO economic impact analysis
-  State law requires fully-informed decisions - this wasn't

> **Lawsuit filed to overturn unlawful approval**

---

###  **SECRET DEALINGS**
Officials kept us in the dark:
-  Closed-door meetings for months
-  Non-Disclosure Agreement signed with developers
-  Community learned about project days before vote
-  Even local mayors found out from press releases

> **"Our voices were still not heard."**  
> — Vivian Fuller, Santa Teresa resident

###  **POLLUTION THREAT**
Project Jupiter includes:
-  Natural gas power plants 3-4 miles from Santa Teresa
-  Air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution
-  Microgrid and battery storage facilities
-  NO environmental studies conducted

---

###  **ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM**
Who bears the burden?
- **91% Hispanic community**

- Vulnerable population exploited for corporate profit
