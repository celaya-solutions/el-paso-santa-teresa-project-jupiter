    <h1>PROJECT JUPITER OPPOSITION</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary for Officials and Media</h2>

<strong>Prepared:</strong> January 22, 2026  
<strong>Location:</strong> El Paso, TX & Santa Teresa/Sunland Park, NM  
<strong>Project:</strong> Project Jupiter - $165 Billion Data Center Complex

<hr>

<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

<p>Project Jupiter is a $165 billion hyperscale data center complex proposed for Santa Teresa, New Mexico, that poses severe threats to the health, safety, and economic wellbeing of predominantly Hispanic, low-income communities in Santa Teresa and Sunland Park, NM, and neighboring El Paso, TX. </p>

<strong>A lawsuit was filed on October 17, 2025</strong> by the New Mexico Environmental Law Center on behalf of community residents and organizations, challenging the unlawful approval of this project by the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners.

<hr>

<h2>CRITICAL FACTS</h2>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>$165 BILLION</strong> in Industrial Revenue Bonds approved</li>
<li><strong>Hyperscale data center complex</strong> with natural gas power plants, microgrid, battery storage, and desalination plant</li>
<li>Led by STACK Infrastructure and BorderPlex Digital Assets, LLC</li>
<li>Approved in <strong>4-1 vote on September 19, 2025</strong> despite massive community opposition</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Community at Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>91% Hispanic population</strong></li>
<li><strong>52% low-income residents</strong></li>
<li>Communities of Santa Teresa and Sunland Park, NM; adjacent to El Paso, TX</li>
<li><strong>Already suffering from contaminated water</strong> - arsenic levels above federal safety limits</li>
<li><strong>Decades of inadequate infrastructure</strong> and environmental burdens</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>WHY PROJECT JUPITER MUST BE STOPPED</h2>

<h3>1. LEGAL VIOLATIONS - Unlawful Approval Process</h3>

<strong>The Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>County Commissioners approved project based on <strong>incomplete application with blank and missing pages</strong></li>
<li><strong>No environmental impact assessment</strong> conducted</li>
<li><strong>No economic impact analysis</strong> provided to public</li>
<li><strong>Closed-door meetings</strong> between county officials and developers, including Non-Disclosure Agreements signed months before public notification</li>
<li>Community residents "remained largely unaware of the proposed project up until days before the Board's decision"</li>
</ul>

<strong>The Law Violated:</strong>
<p>State and local law requires county commissioners to make fully-informed decisions based on complete information. The approval was unlawful and procedurally deficient.</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. WATER CRISIS - Community Already Lacks Safe Drinking Water</h3>

<strong>Current Conditions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Santa Teresa and Sunland Park have <strong>lacked access to clean, safe, affordable drinking water for decades</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arsenic contamination</strong> above federal health standards in current water supply</li>
<li>EPA inspection (2025) revealed:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - <strong>3 of 4 arsenic treatment plants offline and bypassed</strong> for over a year</p>
<p>  - Widespread neglect and disrepair of water utility facilities</p>
<p>  - Unsafe drinking water being delivered to homes</p>

<strong>Project Jupiter's Impact:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data centers require <strong>massive water consumption</strong> for cooling operations</li>
<li>Project includes desalination plant - indicating enormous water demand</li>
<li>Will place <strong>immense additional strain</strong> on already failing water infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Communities cannot survive</strong> further depletion of water resources</li>
</ul>

<strong>Resident Testimony:</strong>
<blockquote>"We filed this lawsuit because the community's health is in danger. I'm protecting water rights for the community. Why would commissioners approve Project Jupiter without having all the documents? <strong>How can we live without water? Water is life.</strong>"  </blockquote>
<blockquote>— José Saldaña Jr., Sunland Park resident</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>3. AIR POLLUTION - Natural Gas Power Plants</h3>

<strong>The Threat:</strong>
<p>Project Jupiter requires massive electricity generation, necessitating:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural gas microgrid power plants</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - West Microgrid: 4.1 miles southwest of Santa Teresa</p>
<p>  - East Microgrid: 3.6 miles south of Santa Teresa</p>
<ul>
<li>Air pollution permit applications filed with NM Environment Department by Acoma, LLC</li>
</ul>

<strong>Community Impact:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increased air, noise, light, water, and soil pollution</li>
<li><strong>Health hazards</strong> for residents already bearing disproportionate environmental burdens</li>
<li>No adequate health impact assessment conducted</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>4. INTIMIDATION OF RESIDENTS</h3>

<strong>The Incident:</strong>
<p>On <strong>September 5, 2025</strong>, Doña Ana County Commissioner Shannon Reynolds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publicly exposed</strong> on Facebook the name, home address, and email address of a resident opposing Project Jupiter</li>
<li>Posted a lengthy list of names of residents who submitted public comments opposing the project</li>
<li>Clear attempt to <strong>intimidate and silence community opposition</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong>NMELC Response:</strong>
<p>Sent formal demand letter stating this "gross misconduct" violates constitutional rights of community members to participate in public forums without fear of retaliation, harassment, or safety threats from elected officials.</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE VIOLATION</h3>

<strong>The Pattern:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>91% Hispanic, 52% low-income community</strong></li>
<li>Already suffering from:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - Contaminated drinking water (arsenic)</p>
<p>  - Failed water infrastructure</p>
<p>  - Inadequate public services</p>
<p>  - Decades of environmental neglect</p>

<strong>New Burden:</strong>
<p>Project Jupiter adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Massive water consumption</li>
<li>Air pollution from power plants</li>
<li>Strain on electricity grid</li>
<li>Increased living costs (water rates, electricity rates)</li>
<li>Health and safety risks</li>
</ul>

<strong>This is Environmental Racism:</strong>
<p>Vulnerable minority community forced to bear environmental harms for private corporate profit, without meaningful community consent or adequate environmental protections.</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. ECONOMIC HARM TO RESIDENTS</h3>

<strong>Tax Issues:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>$165 billion in Industrial Revenue Bonds</strong> with Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) structure</li>
<li><strong>Reduces county property tax revenue</strong> that would normally fund public services</li>
<li><strong>LEDA funding approved</strong> to pay Project Jupiter permit fees - taxpayer money supporting private development</li>
</ul>

<strong>Community Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increased water rates (already high, water contaminated)</li>
<li>Increased electricity rates (strain on grid)</li>
<li>Infrastructure deterioration</li>
<li>Health costs from pollution exposure</li>
<li>No demonstrated benefit to local residents</li>
</ul>

<strong>Missing Analysis:</strong>
<blockquote>"There's a missing economic analysis, there's a missing environmental analysis, and certainly, there's a missing community voice"  </blockquote>
<blockquote>— Daisy Maldonado, Director, Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>7. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY</h3>

<strong>Secret Dealings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>County staff and officials engaged in <strong>closed-door meetings</strong> with developers for months</li>
<li><strong>Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</strong> signed with Project Jupiter companies earlier in 2025</li>
<li>Community kept in dark until days before approval vote</li>
</ul>

<strong>Inadequate Public Notice:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Notices only posted online - communities have limited internet access</li>
<li>No notices in Spanish despite 91% Hispanic population</li>
<li>Physical locations in impacted communities not used for notification</li>
<li>Even <strong>Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea</strong> stated: "We're finding out information at the same time that press releases are being released"</li>
</ul>

<strong>Result:</strong>
<blockquote>"Our voices were still not heard"  </blockquote>
<blockquote>— Vivian Fuller, Santa Teresa resident</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>WHAT THIS MEANS FOR EL PASO</h2>

<p>While Project Jupiter is located in Doña Ana County, NM, its impacts directly affect El Paso, TX:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Water Resources:</strong> Rio Grande aquifer serves both regions</li>
<li><strong>Air Quality:</strong> Pollution from microgrid power plants crosses state lines</li>
<li><strong>Electricity Grid:</strong> Regional grid strain affects all borderland communities</li>
<li><strong>Economic Precedent:</strong> Sets dangerous precedent for similar projects in El Paso area</li>
<li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Santa Teresa/Sunland Park residents are part of greater El Paso borderland community</li>
</ul>

<strong>El Paso residents have a stake in opposing Project Jupiter.</strong>

<h2>BOTTOM LINE</h2>

<strong>Project Jupiter is unlawfully approved, environmentally destructive, and fundamentally unjust.</strong>

<p>A predominantly Hispanic, low-income community already suffering from contaminated water and failed infrastructure is being forced to accept a $165 billion project that will:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deplete scarce water resources</strong> in a community that already lacks safe drinking water</li>
<li><strong>Pollute the air</strong> with natural gas power plants</li>
<li><strong>Provide no meaningful benefit</strong> to local residents</li>
<li><strong>Enrich private corporations</strong> at the expense of public health and safety</li>
</ul>

<strong>The approval was rushed, secretive, and based on incomplete information.</strong>

<p>County officials violated the law, silenced community voices, and even intimidated residents who dared to oppose the project.</p>

<strong>This must be stopped.</strong>

<p>The lawsuit provides a legal path to overturn the unlawful approval. Community organizing, media attention, and political pressure can ensure Project Jupiter never breaks ground.</p>

<strong>Water is life. The community's health is in danger. We must act now.</strong>
