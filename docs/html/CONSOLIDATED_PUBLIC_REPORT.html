    <h1>PROJECT JUPITER ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT</h1>
<h2>The $165 Billion Question: Who Decided, What They Promised, and Why It Matters</h2>

<strong>Evidence-Grade Public Report</strong>  
<strong>Doña Ana County, New Mexico</strong>  
<strong>Published</strong>: January 22, 2026  
<strong>Status</strong>: FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  

<hr>

<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

<p>On September 19, 2025, four Doña Ana County Commissioners voted to approve the largest Industrial Revenue Bond in New Mexico history: <strong>$165 billion</strong> in tax breaks for Project Jupiter, a data center development proposed by BorderPlex Digital Assets LLC.</p>

<p>The vote was <strong>4-1</strong>. The same four commissioners voted YES on three separate ordinances over four weeks, giving away:</p>
<ul>
<li>$165 billion in IRB authorization (100% property tax abatement for 30 years)</li>
<li>$50 million in GRT tax share (LEDA incentive)</li>
<li>$4.5 million in reduced permit fees</li>
</ul>

<strong>In exchange</strong>, the county receives:
<ul>
<li>A fixed $12 million/year "PILOT" payment (far less than actual property tax value)</li>
<li>Promises of 750 jobs, 2,500 construction jobs, and $50 billion investment</li>
<li>Commitments on water usage, local hiring, and environmental standards</li>
</ul>

<strong>The problem</strong>: Many of those promises are <strong>not legally enforceable</strong>. The decision process was <strong>closed to the public</strong> until 2 days before the vote. The IRB application allegedly had <strong>"blank and missing pages."</strong> No economic impact analysis. No water study. No environmental review completed.

<p>This report documents:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who voted</strong> and why they're legally, politically, and administratively accountable</li>
<li><strong>What contradictions exist</strong> between promises and enforceability  </li>
<li><strong>How the decision was made</strong> in private, with minimal public input</li>
<li><strong>What you can do</strong> to demand accountability</li>
</ul>

<strong>Every claim in this report is backed by primary sources</strong>: legal documents, court filings, government records, and news coverage. We don't speculate. We document.

<h2>PART I: THE ACTORS</h2>

<h3>The Four Commissioners Who Voted YES</h3>

<p>On September 19, 2025, these four commissioners voted to approve Ordinances 367-2025 and 368-2025. On October 14, 2025, they voted YES again on Ordinance 369-2025.</p>

<strong>4-1 voting record</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez</strong> - YES, YES, YES</li>
<li><strong>Gloria Gameros</strong> - YES, YES, YES</li>
<li><strong>Shannon Reynolds</strong> - YES, YES, YES (also doxxed residents who opposed project)</li>
<li><strong>Manuel A. Sanchez</strong> - YES, YES, YES</li>
</ul>

<strong>The dissent</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Susana Chaparro</strong> - NO, NO, NO (only commissioner to oppose all three ordinances)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>The Governor Who Committed First</h3>

<p>Seven months before the county voted, <strong>New Mexico's Governor</strong> signed a Memorandum of Understanding with BorderPlex Digital on <strong>February 25, 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>That state MOU committed New Mexico to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classify natural gas as a <strong>"zero carbon resource"</strong> (scientifically false, legally dubious)</li>
<li><strong>Subsidize brackish water drilling costs</strong> with public funds</li>
<li><strong>Fast-track environmental permits</strong> and water rights transfers</li>
<li>Support the project through LEDA and other state incentives</li>
</ul>

<p>The state committed <strong>before the county</strong>, <strong>before the public</strong>, and <strong>before any environmental review</strong>.</p>

<strong>Source</strong>: State MOU dated 2025-02-25, signed by Governor

<h3>The Developer: BorderPlex Digital Assets LLC</h3>

<strong>BorderPlex Digital Assets LLC</strong> is the primary developer. The project involves multiple subsidiary entities:
<ul>
<li>Yucca Growth Infrastructure, LLC (Series 2025A lease)</li>
<li>Red Chiles [A/B/C/D], LLC (Series 2025B lease)</li>
<li>Green Chile Ventures LLC (Series 2025B lease)</li>
<li>[Series 2025C entities]</li>
</ul>

<strong>CEO</strong>: Lanham Napier (testified to NM legislature Aug 19, 2025)

<strong>Alleged connection</strong>: News reports suggest ties to OpenAI's $500 billion "Stargate" AI initiative, but this remains unconfirmed by official sources.

<strong>Sources</strong>: County MOU; Series 2025A/B lease documents; news coverage

<hr>

<h3>The Opposition: Community Groups and Legal Challengers</h3>

<strong>Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County</strong> organized protests, filed a lawsuit on October 17, 2025 (Case D-307-CV-2025-02766), and mobilized community members to attend commission meetings.

<strong>New Mexico Environmental Law Center (NMELC)</strong> provided legal support, filed formal complaints (including Commissioner Reynolds' doxxing incident), and advocated with state regulatory agencies.

<strong>Individual plaintiffs</strong>: José Saldaña Jr., Vivian Fuller

<strong>Community activists</strong>: Daisy Maldonado (Empower NM) and dozens of residents who spoke at meetings with signs reading <strong>"You Can't Drink Data."</strong>

<h2>PART II: THE PROMISES VS. REALITY</h2>

<h3>What They Promised</h3>

<p>| Promise | Source | Enforceability |</p>
<p>|---------|--------|----------------|</p>
<p>| 750 full-time jobs, 50 part-time jobs, 2,500 construction jobs | County MOU Section 2.3, 2.4 | <strong>Weak</strong>: "Best efforts" local hiring (Series 2025B Lease §4.18); PILOT increase mechanism if job targets missed (§4.20), but unclear triggers |</p>
<p>| Salaries $75,000-$100,000 | Series 2025B Lease Recitals P14 | <strong>Recital only</strong> (not binding covenant) |</p>
<p>| Closed-loop cooling, avg 20k gpd, peak 60k gpd water use | Series 2025B Lease Recitals P13 | <strong>Recital only</strong>; no monitoring mechanism or penalty disclosed |</p>
<p>| $50 billion initial investment, up to $165 billion over 30 years | County MOU Section 2.1 | <strong>MOU Section 5.1 states MOU creates "no legal rights or obligations"</strong> except Appendix B contributions |</p>
<p>| $12 million/year PILOT payment | County MOU Section 3.6; Lease agreements | <strong>Enforceable</strong> (contractual obligation) |</p>
<p>| $50 million GRT share (LEDA) for county projects | LEDA PPA dated 2025-09-17 | <strong>Enforceable</strong>, but only for "eligible project costs" developer approves (PPA §3.5) |</p>
<p>| $6.9 million in community contributions (workforce, Boys & Girls Club, desalination, etc.) | County MOU Appendix B | <strong>Enforceable</strong> only after MOU execution and ordinance approvals (MOU §5.2) |</p>
<p>| Microgrid "will not impact existing customers' power reliability or costs" | County MOU Section 3.4.4 | <strong>No study disclosed</strong>; claim unverified |</p>
<p>| Net zero carbon by 2045 per HB93 | County MOU Section 3.4.4 | <strong>State law requirement</strong>, but Governor's MOU claims natural gas = "zero carbon" (contradiction) |</p>

<h3>The Contradictions</h3>

<strong>15 documented contradictions</strong> between:
<ul>
<li>Public promises vs. legal enforceability (MOU §5.1 disclaims legal obligations)</li>
<li>State MOU (natural gas = zero carbon) vs. County MOU (HB93 net zero requirement)</li>
<li>Initial documents (missing water caps) vs. updated documents (water caps added)</li>
<li>County counsel's advice (jobs/revenue not required in application) vs. lease commitments (specific job numbers)</li>
<li>Environmental review timeline (incomplete, 6 months away) vs. construction schedule (Q4 2025 start)</li>
<li>Open Meetings Act requirements vs. actual process (NDA, private meetings, 2-day document release)</li>
</ul>

<h2>PART III: THE DECISION PROCESS</h2>

<h3>Timeline: From Secret Meetings to Rubber-Stamp Vote</h3>

<p>| Date | Event |</p>
<p>|------|-------|</p>
<p>| <strong>Early 2025</strong> | County officials sign NDA with BorderPlex; private meetings held (months before public hearings) |</p>
<p>| <strong>Feb 25, 2025</strong> | Governor signs State MOU (7 months before county vote) |</p>
<p>| <strong>Aug 19, 2025</strong> | Community protests at Legislative Finance Committee; "You Can't Drink Data" |</p>
<p>| <strong>Sept 5, 2025</strong> | Commissioner Shannon Reynolds doxxes residents who opposed project on Facebook |</p>
<p>| <strong>Sept 8, 2025</strong> | NMELC files formal complaint about doxxing |</p>
<p>| <strong>Sept 17, 2025</strong> | Documents released to public (2 days before vote) |</p>
<p>| <strong>Sept 19, 2025</strong> | Public hearing and vote (4-1 approval of IRB and LEDA GRT ordinances) |</p>
<p>| <strong>Oct 14, 2025</strong> | Second vote (4-1 approval of LEDA permit fee ordinance) |</p>
<p>| <strong>Oct 17, 2025</strong> | Lawsuit filed challenging all three ordinances |</p>

<h3>Open Meetings Act Violations Alleged</h3>

<p>New Mexico's Open Meetings Act (NMSA § 10-15-1) requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public business conducted in open meetings</li>
<li>Reasonable advance notice</li>
<li>Opportunity for public review of materials</li>
</ul>

<strong>What happened instead</strong>:
<ul>
<li>NDA signed in early 2025 (closed-door negotiations)</li>
<li>Private meetings held for months</li>
<li>Final documents released Sept 17, just 2 days before Sept 19 vote</li>
<li>Mayor of Sunland Park said he was "finding out information the same time as press releases"</li>
<li>IPRA requests for public records delayed or obstructed</li>
</ul>

<strong>Legal consequence</strong>: Violations of the Open Meetings Act are <strong>criminal misdemeanors</strong> (NMSA § 10-15-3). Actions taken in violation may be <strong>voidable</strong>.

<strong>Source</strong>: Legal complaint; news coverage; Amended Motion for Stay

<hr>

<h3>The Incomplete Application</h3>

<p>The legal complaint filed October 17, 2025, alleges the IRB application contained <strong>"blank and missing pages"</strong> and lacked critical information required by statute.</p>

<p>New Mexico law (NMSA § 3-32-6) requires IRB applications to include financial projections, job creation data, and economic benefit analysis.</p>

<p>County Counsel told commissioners that jobs and revenue projections weren't required to be "specified in the application." But if the information wasn't in the application, <strong>how did commissioners verify the project's claims</strong>?</p>

<p>The county approved <strong>$165 billion</strong>—the largest IRB in state history—without complete information.</p>

<strong>Source</strong>: Petition for Writ of Certiorari, filed Oct 17, 2025; Amended Motion for Stay

<hr>

<h2>PART IV: THE MISSING ANALYSES</h2>

<h3>No Economic Impact Study</h3>

<strong>What's missing</strong>: Independent analysis comparing 30 years of property tax revenue (without abatement) to $12 million/year PILOT payment.

<strong>Why it matters</strong>: Property taxes on a $50 billion (potentially $165 billion) project would be worth <strong>billions</strong> over 30 years. The county settled for $360 million ($12M x 30 years). Who got the better deal?

<strong>Source</strong>: Absence documented in news coverage (KFOX14, Sept 19, 2025); PROJECT_JUPITER_ACCOUNTABILITY_MATRIX.csv row ISSUE-0030

<hr>

<h3>No Water Impact Study</h3>

<strong>What's missing</strong>: Hydrological analysis of project's impact on Mesilla Basin aquifer.

<strong>Why it matters</strong>: The basin is already water-stressed. Project plans to use up to 60,000 gallons/day (peak), with no disclosed monitoring or enforcement mechanism.

<p>The state committed to <strong>subsidize brackish water drilling</strong> (State MOU lines 16-22), using public funds for private water use—but where's the public benefit analysis?</p>

<strong>Source</strong>: Absence documented in PROJECT_JUPITER_ACCOUNTABILITY_MATRIX.csv row ISSUE-0033; no aquifer study released by county

<hr>

<h3>No Environmental Review Completed</h3>

<strong>What's missing</strong>: Environmental assessment incomplete as of November 4, 2025 (expected within 6 months).

<strong>Why it matters</strong>: Construction is scheduled for Q4 2025. The county approved permits before environmental review was complete.

<strong>Contradiction</strong>: Environmental safeguards require review <strong>before</strong> construction, not during.

<strong>Source</strong>: Amended Motion for Stay (environmental assessment status letter); County MOU Section 2.2 (construction timeline)

<hr>

<h3>No Grid Impact Study</h3>

<strong>What's missing</strong>: Load analysis and grid interconnection study for Project Jupiter's microgrid.

<strong>Why it matters</strong>: The MOU claims the microgrid "will not impact existing customers' power reliability or costs"—but based on what analysis?

<strong>Source</strong>: County MOU Section 3.4.4 (claim); no supporting study disclosed

<hr>

<h2>PART V: ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK</h2>

<h2>PART VIII: KEY FINDINGS</h2>

<h3>Finding 1: The Decision Was Made in Private</h3>
<p>NDA, private meetings, and 2-day document release violated the spirit—and likely the letter—of New Mexico's Open Meetings Act.</p>

<h3>Finding 2: The State Pre-Empted Local Control</h3>
<p>Governor's Feb 25 MOU committed New Mexico 7 months before county vote, creating political pressure on commissioners.</p>

<h3>Finding 3: The Application Was Incomplete</h3>
<p>Legal complaint alleges "blank and missing pages" in IRB application. County approved $165 billion without complete information.</p>

<h3>Finding 4: Key Promises Are Unenforceable</h3>
<p>MOU Section 5.1 disclaims legal obligations for most commitments (jobs, investment, environmental claims). Only Appendix B contributions are binding.</p>

<h3>Finding 5: Critical Analyses Were Absent</h3>
<p>No economic impact study. No water impact study. No completed environmental review. Commissioners voted blind.</p>

<h3>Finding 6: Natural Gas Is Not Zero Carbon</h3>
<p>State MOU's claim that natural gas qualifies as "zero carbon" contradicts science, state law (HB93), and basic chemistry.</p>

<h3>Finding 7: A 4-1 Voting Bloc Controlled the Outcome</h3>
<p>Four commissioners voted identically three times. Susana Chaparro stood alone in opposition.</p>

<h3>Finding 8: Retaliation Against Opposition Occurred</h3>
<p>Commissioner Reynolds doxxed residents who opposed the project, then voted YES. Intimidation + support = evidence of personal stake or external pressure.</p>

<h3>Finding 9: Documents Changed After Initial Release</h3>
<p>Water caps and $6.9M contributions reportedly missing from early documents, added later. Version control failure or deliberate withholding.</p>

<h3>Finding 10: The Public Was Excluded</h3>
<p>Mayor of Sunland Park (adjacent municipality) excluded. Community members given 2 days to review documents. IPRA requests delayed or obstructed.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>Four county commissioners gave away billions in tax revenue for promises that may not be legally enforceable.</p>

<p>They did so in private, with minimal public input, and without the economic, water, and environmental analyses the community deserves.</p>

<p>One commissioner doxxed residents who opposed the project.</p>

<p>The largest IRB in New Mexico history was approved based on an allegedly incomplete application.</p>

<strong>These are the facts. These are the names. This is what happened.</strong>

The question now is: <strong>What are you going to do about it?</strong>
