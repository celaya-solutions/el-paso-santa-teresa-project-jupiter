<h2>DETAILED CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS</h2>

<h3>CONTRA-001: Natural Gas as "Zero Carbon"</h3>
<strong>Status</strong>: Active Legal/Scientific Contradiction

<strong>Source A</strong>: State of New Mexico MOU with BorderPlex Digital Assets LLC, dated 2025-02-25  
<ul>
<li>Citation: Lines 115-125  </li>
<li>Statement: "the State of New Mexico supports the position that electricity generated from natural gas and nuclear resources developed for a micro-grid system may also qualify as a 'zero carbon resource'"  </li>
<li>Signed by: New Mexico Governor  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Source B</strong>: County MOU Section 3.4.4, executed 2025-09-24  
<ul>
<li>Citation: MOU Section 3.4.4, "Onsite Microgrid"  </li>
<li>Statement: "HB93 further requires that by 2045, all power from qualified microgrids must come from net zero carbon resources"  </li>
<li>Context: Acknowledges state law requires actual net zero carbon by 2045  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Impact</strong>: The state's political position that natural gas qualifies as "zero carbon" contradicts both scientific reality and existing state law (HB93). This creates legal uncertainty about project compliance and masks true environmental impact from public.

<hr>

<h3>CONTRA-002: MOU Enforceability vs Public Promises</h3>
<strong>Status</strong>: Enforcement Gap with Public Deception

<strong>Source A</strong>: Public statements by County Manager Stephen Lopez, 2025-09-19  
<ul>
<li>Citation: KFOX14 coverage, Sept 19, 2025  </li>
<li>Statement: Promoted project as bringing "thousands of jobs" and economic benefits  </li>
<li>Context: Presented to public and commissioners as binding commitments  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Source B</strong>: Project Jupiter County MOU, Section 5.1  
<ul>
<li>Citation: MOU §5.1, executed 2025-09-24  </li>
<li>Statement: "This MOU does not create legal rights or obligations" except Appendix B contributions (contingent on approvals)  </li>
<li>Legal Effect: Most commitments are non-enforceable  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Impact</strong>: Public was misled about which project promises are legally binding. Only Appendix B financial contributions are enforceable, and only after all approvals granted. Job commitments, water caps, and environmental promises may be unenforceable representations.

<hr>

<h3>CONTRA-003: Document Version Control</h3>
<strong>Status</strong>: Transparency Failure

<strong>Source A</strong>: Initial public document release, circa 2025-10-01  
<ul>
<li>Citation: Haussamen article, Oct 12, 2025, describing earlier documents  </li>
<li>Omissions: Water usage limits, $6.9M community contributions  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Source B</strong>: Updated lease/MOU documents, available by 2025-10-12  
<ul>
<li>Citation: Series 2025B Lease recitals (P13); MOU Appendix B  </li>
<li>Additions: 20k gpd avg / 60k gpd peak water caps; $6.9M contribution schedule  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Impact</strong>: Critical project terms were either withheld from initial public release or added after the fact. This raises questions about post-vote document modification and whether commissioners voted on complete information.

<hr>

<h3>CONTRA-008: Environmental Review vs Construction Timeline</h3>
<strong>Status</strong>: Regulatory Process Conflict

<strong>Source A</strong>: Environmental Assessment Status Letter, 2025-11-04  
<ul>
<li>Citation: Amended Motion for Stay attachment  </li>
<li>Statement: Environmental assessment incomplete, expected within six months  </li>
<li>Timeline: Would complete around May 2026  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Source B</strong>: Project Construction Schedule in MOU 2.2  
<ul>
<li>Citation: County MOU Section 2.2, executed 2025-09-24  </li>
<li>Statement: "Construction is expected to commence in Q4 2025... with initial capacity operational in Q4 2026"  </li>
<li>Timeline: Construction starting October-December 2025  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Impact</strong>: Construction is scheduled to begin before environmental review is complete. This suggests either environmental review is not a precondition for construction permits, or regulatory safeguards are being circumvented.

<hr>

<h3>CONTRA-009: Transparency and Public Participation</h3>
<strong>Status</strong>: Open Meetings Act Violations Alleged

<strong>Source A</strong>: County officials' duty under Open Meetings Act  
<ul>
<li>Legal Standard: Public business must be conducted in open meetings with proper notice  </li>
<li>Requirement: Meaningful opportunity for public review of materials before votes  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Source B</strong>: Actual Process (per legal filings and news coverage)  
<ul>
<li>Timeline: NDA signed with developers in early 2025 (source: legal complaint)  </li>
<li>Private meetings: Held months before public hearings (source: KFOX14 coverage)  </li>
<li>Document release: Sept 17, 2025 (2 days before Sept 19 vote)  </li>
<li>IPRA obstruction: County delayed document production despite having compiled materials  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Impact</strong>: Decision appears to have been made in private, with public process serving as rubber stamp. Limited document review time prevented meaningful public participation.

<hr>

<h3>CONTRA-015: IRB Application Completeness</h3>
<strong>Status</strong>: Due Diligence Failure

<strong>Source A</strong>: Standard IRB Application Requirements  
<ul>
<li>Legal Standard: Complete application with required financial, technical, and economic information  </li>
<li>Due Diligence: County must verify information before approving $165B in bonds  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Source B</strong>: Actual Application Condition (per legal complaint)  
<ul>
<li>Citation: Petition for Writ of Certiorari, filed 2025-10-17  </li>
<li>Allegation: Application contained "blank and missing pages" and lacked critical information  </li>
<li>Approval: County approved IRB on 2025-09-19 despite incomplete application  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Impact</strong>: Largest IRB in New Mexico history ($165 billion) approved without complete application. Suggests either gross negligence or deliberate avoidance of scrutiny.
