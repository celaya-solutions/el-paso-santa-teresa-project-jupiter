<hr>

<h3>Communication Patterns and Red Flags</h3>

#### <strong>Pattern 1: State Pre-Commitment</strong>
<strong>Timeline</strong>: Feb 25 (State MOU) → Sept 19 (County vote)  
<strong>Significance</strong>: State committed 7 months before local approval  
<strong>Implication</strong>: State pressure on county to approve project already blessed at state level  

<strong>Network</strong>: Governor's Office → NMED/State Engineer/EDD → County (via political channels, not documented)

<strong>Red Flag</strong>: Did state officials pressure county commissioners? Phone logs and emails needed (IPRA request).

<hr>

#### <strong>Pattern 2: Private-to-Public Transition</strong>
<strong>Timeline</strong>: Early 2025 (NDA + private meetings) → Sept 17 (document release) → Sept 19 (vote)  
<strong>Significance</strong>: Months of private negotiations, then 2-day public review  
<strong>Implication</strong>: Decision made privately, public process was theater  

<strong>Network</strong>: BorderPlex ↔ County Commissioners/Staff (NDA shield) → Public (controlled release)

<strong>Red Flag</strong>: Who attended private meetings? What was discussed? NDA prevents disclosure, but Open Meetings Act may void NDA for public officials conducting public business.

<hr>

#### <strong>Pattern 3: Coordinated 4-1 Voting Bloc</strong>
<strong>Timeline</strong>: Sept 19 (2 YES votes) + Oct 14 (1 YES vote) = 3 identical 4-1 outcomes  
<strong>Significance</strong>: Four commissioners voted identically three times  
<strong>Implication</strong>: Either coordinated decision-making OR shared pressure/incentive  

<strong>Network</strong>: Schaljo-Hernandez + Gameros + Reynolds + Sanchez (voting bloc)

<strong>Red Flag</strong>: Did the four communicate outside public meetings to coordinate votes? If so, Open Meetings Act violation.

<strong>Research Needed</strong>: Text messages, emails, phone logs among the four commissioners (IPRA request).

<hr>

#### <strong>Pattern 4: Retaliation Against Opposition</strong>
<strong>Timeline</strong>: Community protests → Reynolds doxxing (Sept 5) → YES votes (Sept 19, Oct 14)  
<strong>Significance</strong>: Reynolds targeted opponents, then voted for project they opposed  
<strong>Implication</strong>: Intimidation to suppress dissent + personal stake in project approval  

<strong>Network</strong>: Community opponents → Reynolds (hostile response) → BorderPlex (vote support)

<strong>Red Flag</strong>: Did Reynolds have undisclosed connections to BorderPlex or financial interest in project approval?

<hr>

#### <strong>Pattern 5: Document Version Control Issues</strong>
<strong>Timeline</strong>: Oct 1 (initial docs, omissions) → Oct 12 (updated docs with water caps and $6.9M)  
<strong>Significance</strong>: Key commitments added or disclosed after vote  
<strong>Implication</strong>: Either post-vote document modification OR selective initial disclosure  

<strong>Network</strong>: County Staff/BorderPlex (document preparation) → Public (controlled release)

<strong>Red Flag</strong>: Were documents altered after Sept 19 vote? Who authorized changes? Forensic document analysis needed (metadata, version history).

<hr>

#### <strong>Pattern 6: Synchronization of Execution and Lawsuit</strong>
<strong>Timeline</strong>: Oct 17 (lawsuit filed) = Oct 17 (Community Development Agreement signed)  
<strong>Significance</strong>: County executed another agreement on the same day lawsuit was filed  
<strong>Implication</strong>: Rush to finalize binding commitments despite legal challenge  

<strong>Network</strong>: County + BorderPlex (execution) | Plaintiffs (legal challenge)

<strong>Red Flag</strong>: Did county rush execution to create additional legal barriers to unwinding the deal?

<hr>

<h3>Participation in Executive Sessions</h3>

<strong>Research Needed</strong>: Review commission meeting agendas for executive sessions Feb-Oct 2025  
<strong>Key Questions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>How many executive sessions were held during Project Jupiter timeline?</li>
<li>What were the stated reasons (legal advice, real estate, personnel)?</li>
<li>Were executive session minutes properly sealed and logged?</li>
<li>Was BorderPlex discussed in executive sessions? (May be disclosable under IPRA if discussions exceeded legal justification)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Method</strong>: IPRA request for:
<ul>
<li>All executive session agendas and stated reasons (Feb-Oct 2025)</li>
<li>Certification that executive sessions complied with Open Meetings Act</li>
<li>Any executive session minutes related to "economic development" or "BorderPlex" or "Project Jupiter"</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Hiring Linkages</h3>

<strong>Research Needed</strong>: County employment records  
<strong>Key Questions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Were any county staff hired from BorderPlex or affiliated companies?</li>
<li>Were any county staff hired to positions related to Project Jupiter after State MOU signed (Feb 25)?</li>
<li>Were any consultants hired to work on Project Jupiter? Who selected them? What were their connections?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Method</strong>: IPRA request for:
<ul>
<li>All consultant contracts related to Project Jupiter or economic development (Jan 2025-present)</li>
<li>Employment records for county economic development staff (hires/promotions Feb 2025-present)</li>
<li>Resumes and hiring justifications for any positions created or filled during Project Jupiter timeline</li>
</ul>

<strong>Red Flag to watch for</strong>: "Revolving door" between BorderPlex/affiliates and county staff

<hr>

<h3>Announcement Timing</h3>

<strong>Research Needed</strong>: Compare announcement timing to other major news events  
<strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Were Project Jupiter announcements timed to minimize media attention?

<strong>Method</strong>: Media calendar analysis
<ul>
<li>Sept 17 (Fri) document release → Sept 19 (Sun) vote = weekend timing, minimal news cycle coverage</li>
<li>Check: Were other major local/state news events occurring Sept 17-19 that could distract media?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Red Flag</strong>: Strategic timing to avoid scrutiny

<hr>

<hr>

<h2>KEY FINDINGS</h2>

<h3>1. State Pre-Empted Local Control</h3>
<p>The Governor's Feb 25 MOU created fait accompli pressure on county decision. State committed regulatory fast-tracking before county vote.</p>

<h3>2. Closed-Door Decision-Making</h3>
<p>NDA + private meetings + 2-day document release = Decision made privately, public process was formality.</p>

<h3>3. Coordinated Voting Bloc</h3>
<p>Four commissioners voted identically three times. Coordination suggests either shared agenda or shared pressure.</p>

<h3>4. Retaliation Pattern</h3>
<p>Reynolds doxxed opponents, then voted for project. Intimidation + support = evidence of personal stake or external pressure.</p>

<h3>5. Document Control Issues</h3>
<p>Version discrepancies and late releases suggest either post-vote modifications or strategic withholding of key terms.</p>

<h3>6. Municipal Exclusion</h3>
<p>Sunland Park Mayor excluded despite project proximity. County bypassed affected municipality's input.</p>

<hr>

<h2>RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATIONS</h2>

<h3>Legal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open Meetings Act compliance review (executive sessions, NDA, private meetings)</li>
<li>Conflict of interest investigation (commissioners' financial ties to BorderPlex or affiliates)</li>
<li>Document forensics (metadata analysis of MOUs and leases to detect post-vote modifications)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Records Requests (IPRA)</h3>
<ul>
<li>All communications (emails, texts, calls) between commissioners and BorderPlex (Jan-Oct 2025)</li>
<li>All executive session agendas and minutes (Feb-Oct 2025)</li>
<li>Consultant contracts and hiring records related to Project Jupiter</li>
<li>County Counsel's written legal advice on IRB application completeness</li>
</ul>

<h3>Investigative Journalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interview County Manager Stephen Lopez (on record: Why no economic analysis?)</li>
<li>Interview Commissioner Chaparro (on record: Why did she vote NO?)</li>
<li>Background investigation of BorderPlex entities (corporate structure, beneficial ownership)</li>
<li>Campaign finance deep dive (all four YES voters + shared donors)</li>
</ul>

<hr>
