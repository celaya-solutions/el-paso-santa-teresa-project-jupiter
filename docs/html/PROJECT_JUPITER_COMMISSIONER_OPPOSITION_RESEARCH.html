<h2>DISTRICT 1: CHRISTOPHER SCHALJO HERNANDEZ (CHAIR)</h2>

<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Position:</strong> District 1 Commissioner, Board Chair</li>
<li><strong>District:</strong> District 1 (likely includes parts of Las Cruces and surrounding areas - verify exact boundaries)</li>
<li><strong>Contact:</strong> Via Doña Ana County main number or BoCC@dona-ana.state.nm.us</li>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> Elected official; Chair position indicates leadership role and responsibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Jupiter Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sept 19, 2025:</strong> Voted YES on Ordinance 367 (IRB - $165B) and Ordinance 368 (LEDA GRT Share)</li>
<li><strong>Oct 14, 2025:</strong> Voted YES on Ordinance 369 (LEDA Building Permit Fees)</li>
<li><strong>As Chair:</strong> Would have presided over both meetings; responsible for setting agenda and managing public comment period</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accountability Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leadership Responsibility:</strong> As Board Chair, bears primary responsibility for:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Allowing votes to proceed despite incomplete application</p>
<p>   - Permitting approval without economic or environmental analysis</p>
<p>   - Not preventing or condemning Commissioner Reynolds' doxxing incident</p>
<p>   - Setting tone that enabled secretive process</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Failure to Delay:</strong> Despite:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Community requests for more time (Daisy Maldonado, Empower NM)</p>
<p>   - City of Sunland Park official request for delay (Mayor Perea)</p>
<p>   - Missing critical information (economic analysis, environmental review)</p>
<p>   - Legal concerns raised by residents</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Procedural Failures:</strong> As Chair, responsible for ensuring:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Complete applications before consideration (not enforced)</p>
<p>   - Adequate public notice and engagement (arguably failed)</p>
<p>   - Compliance with Open Meetings Act (violated with secret NDA meetings)</p>
<p>   - Fair public comment process (compromised by intimidation)</p>

<h3>Political Vulnerabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chair Title = Higher Profile:</strong> More visible than other commissioners; can't hide behind anonymity</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Accountability:</strong> Voters can argue "the buck stops here"</li>
<li><strong>District Boundaries:</strong> Need to identify key communities in District 1 affected by Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opposition Research Needs</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Campaign finance records: Did he receive contributions from tech industry, real estate developers, or entities connected to BorderPlex/STACK?</li>
<li>[ ] Past votes: Does he have pattern of approving development projects without adequate review?</li>
<li>[ ] Professional background: Any conflicts of interest (business ties to tech, real estate, energy)?</li>
<li>[ ] Public statements: Has he made claims about Jupiter that can be fact-checked (job numbers, economic benefits)?</li>
<li>[ ] Election history: Margin of victory in last election? Vulnerability for recall or next election?</li>
<li>[ ] Social media: Posts supporting Jupiter? Interactions with developers? Corporate ties?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Talking Points Against</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Chair Schaljo Hernandez presided over the most corrupt approval process in county history"</li>
<li>"As Chair, he had the power to delay the vote—he chose not to"</li>
<li>"He allowed $165 billion to be approved based on an application with blank pages"</li>
<li>"Leadership means protecting the public interest—he failed"</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>DISTRICT 2: GLORIA GAMEROS</h2>

<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Position:</strong> District 2 Commissioner</li>
<li><strong>District:</strong> District 2 (verify boundaries - may include southern county areas)</li>
<li><strong>Contact:</strong> Via county main number or BoCC email</li>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> Elected official</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Jupiter Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sept 19, 2025:</strong> Voted YES on Ordinance 367 (IRB) and Ordinance 368 (LEDA GRT)</li>
<li><strong>Oct 14, 2025:</strong> Voted YES on Ordinance 369 (LEDA Building Permit Fees)</li>
<li><strong>Public statements:</strong> Unknown (research needed)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accountability Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voted YES Twice:</strong> Double down on approval despite:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Intervening community opposition between Sept 19 and Oct 14</p>
<p>   - Lawsuit filing on Oct 17 (3 days after second vote)</p>
<p>   - Growing public awareness of problems with application</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignored Constituents:</strong> If District 2 includes Sunland Park or Santa Teresa:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Direct betrayal of most-impacted communities</p>
<p>   - Voted against neighborhoods that will bear water/environmental burden</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Silent Complicity:</strong> No public statements (that we've found) defending vote:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Suggests either shame about decision or indifference to public concern</p>
<p>   - Allows other commissioners to take heat while staying quiet</p>

<h3>Political Vulnerabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Profile = Less Scrutiny:</strong> May be unprepared for targeted advocacy/accountability</li>
<li><strong>Anonymity in Media:</strong> Most news articles don't name her; can be framed as "hiding"</li>
<li><strong>If District 2 Includes Impacted Areas:</strong> Direct electoral vulnerability from angry constituents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opposition Research Needs</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] District boundaries: Does District 2 include Sunland Park, Santa Teresa, or other directly affected areas?</li>
<li>[ ] Electoral margins: Close race or safe seat?</li>
<li>[ ] Campaign finance: Contributions from development interests?</li>
<li>[ ] Past votes: Pattern of pro-development voting?</li>
<li>[ ] Public statements on Jupiter: Any on record? Can be held accountable for claims?</li>
<li>[ ] Community ties: Does she live in or near affected areas (makes betrayal more personal)?</li>
<li>[ ] Professional background: Conflicts of interest?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Talking Points Against</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Commissioner Gameros voted YES twice—even after seeing community opposition"</li>
<li>"She won't even defend her vote publicly"</li>
<li>"Is she representing District 2 residents, or corporate interests?"</li>
<li>"Silence isn't neutrality—it's complicity"</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>DISTRICT 3: SHANNON REYNOLDS</h2>

<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Position:</strong> District 3 Commissioner</li>
<li><strong>District:</strong> District 3 (verify boundaries)</li>
<li><strong>Contact:</strong> Via county main number; active on Facebook (confirmed)</li>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> Elected official; MOST VULNERABLE due to doxxing incident</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Jupiter Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sept 19, 2025:</strong> Voted YES on Ordinance 367 (IRB) and Ordinance 368 (LEDA GRT)</li>
<li><strong>Oct 14, 2025:</strong> Voted YES on Ordinance 369 (LEDA Building Permit Fees)</li>
<li><strong>Sept 5, 2025:</strong> Posted names and home addresses of residents opposing Jupiter on Facebook</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accountability Issues - EXTENSIVE</h3>

<p>#### 1. DOXXING INCIDENT (Sept 5, 2025)</p>
<strong>What Happened:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Posted to Facebook: Name, home address, and email of at least one New Mexico resident opposing Jupiter</li>
<li>Posted lengthy list of names of individuals (many Doña Ana County residents) who submitted written public comment in opposition</li>
<li>Clear intent: Intimidation and retaliation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Why This Matters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Amendment Violation:</strong> Retaliation against residents for exercising free speech rights</li>
<li><strong>Abuse of Office:</strong> Used position to access public comment records, then weaponized that access</li>
<li><strong>Invasion of Privacy:</strong> Exposed personal information that could endanger residents</li>
<li><strong>Creating Chilling Effect:</strong> Discourages future public participation (if you speak up, you'll be doxxed)</li>
<li><strong>Potential Criminal Violation:</strong> Depending on NM law, could constitute harassment, intimidation, or misuse of public records</li>
</ul>

<strong>Official Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>New Mexico Environmental Law Center sent formal letter on Sept 8, 2025 to:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - Commissioner Shannon Reynolds</p>
<p>  - Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners</p>
<p>  - County Management</p>
<ul>
<li>NMELC demanded:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - Immediate action to ensure misconduct doesn't happen again</p>
<p>  - Protection for community members participating in public forums</p>
<p>  - Guarantee against retaliation, harassment, and threats to safety</p>

<strong>Consequences for Reynolds:</strong>
<ul>
<li>NMELC stated: "We Will Defend the Constitutional Rights of Community Members to Submit Comments and Will Not Tolerate Intimidation Tactics"</li>
<li>Created documented record of misconduct</li>
<li>Establishes pattern of hostility toward Jupiter opponents</li>
</ul>

<p>#### 2. Pattern of Pro-Jupiter Advocacy</p>
<ul>
<li>Voted YES twice despite overwhelming community opposition</li>
<li>Doxxing indicates personal investment in Jupiter's approval (beyond normal commissioner duty)</li>
<li>Suggests possible:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - Financial interest (investigate)</p>
<p>  - Ideological commitment to development at any cost</p>
<p>  - Personal relationship with developers (investigate)</p>

<p>#### 3. Violation of Public Trust</p>
<ul>
<li>Commissioners are supposed to WELCOME public input, not punish it</li>
<li>By doxxing opponents, she signaled: "If you oppose me, I will retaliate"</li>
<li>Fundamental breach of democratic norms</li>
</ul>

<h3>Political Vulnerabilities - SEVERE</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Documented Misconduct:</strong> NMELC letter creates paper trail; can be used in:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Recall campaign</p>
<p>   - Ethics complaint</p>
<p>   - Civil lawsuit (by doxxed individuals)</p>
<p>   - Criminal complaint (potentially)</p>
<p>   - Opposition campaign materials</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Public Outrage:</strong> Doxxing universally condemned; even Jupiter supporters may not defend it</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Legal Exposure:</strong> Individuals who were doxxed could sue for:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Invasion of privacy</p>
<p>   - Intentional infliction of emotional distress</p>
<p>   - Civil rights violations (§1983 claim if acting under color of state law)</p>
<p>   - Injunctive relief</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Media Narrative:</strong> "Commissioner who doxxed residents voted for $165B corporate giveaway" writes itself</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recall Vulnerability:</strong> If NM law allows recall of county commissioners, Reynolds is prime target</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opposition Research Needs - PRIORITY</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] <strong>URGENT:</strong> Obtain copy of actual Facebook post (screenshot, archive)</li>
<li>[ ] Identify all individuals doxxed (potential plaintiffs in civil suit)</li>
<li>[ ] Document any harm suffered (harassment, threats, need to move, emotional distress)</li>
<li>[ ] Campaign finance: Contributions from BorderPlex, STACK, related entities, or tech industry?</li>
<li>[ ] Professional ties: Does she work in tech, real estate, energy, or related field?</li>
<li>[ ] Past misconduct: Other incidents of retaliation or abuse of office?</li>
<li>[ ] Social media audit: Other problematic posts? Pattern of hostility toward residents?</li>
<li>[ ] Relationships with developers: Personal or professional ties to BorderPlex, Lanham Napier, STACK Infrastructure?</li>
<li>[ ] Property interests: Does she own land that would benefit from Jupiter (water infrastructure, road improvements, etc.)?</li>
<li>[ ] NDA involvement: Was she personally involved in signing county NDA with developers?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal Actions Available Against Reynolds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethics Complaint:</strong> File with NM Secretary of State or county ethics board (if exists)</li>
<li><strong>Civil Lawsuit:</strong> Class action by all doxxed individuals</li>
<li><strong>Criminal Complaint:</strong> Harassment, intimidation, or misuse of public records (consult NM criminal attorney)</li>
<li><strong>Recall Petition:</strong> If allowed under NM law for county commissioners</li>
<li><strong>Federal Civil Rights Claim:</strong> §1983 lawsuit for First Amendment retaliation</li>
<li><strong>Public Records Request:</strong> IPRA request for:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - All communications between Reynolds and developers</p>
<p>   - Records showing how she obtained doxxed individuals' information</p>
<p>   - Any complaints filed against her</p>
<p>   - County's response to NMELC letter</p>

<h3>Talking Points Against - REYNOLDS IS #1 TARGET</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Commissioner Shannon Reynolds DOXXED residents for opposing Project Jupiter"</li>
<li>"She posted our names and addresses on Facebook to intimidate us"</li>
<li>"This is retaliation for exercising our First Amendment rights"</li>
<li>"She abused her position to access our information, then weaponized it against us"</li>
<li>"Then she voted YES on a $165 billion corporate giveaway"</li>
<li>"This isn't public service—it's corruption and intimidation"</li>
<li>"Shannon Reynolds must resign or be removed from office"</li>
<li><strong>Campaign slogan:</strong> "Reynolds Doxxed Residents, Then Sold Out Our County" #ResignReynolds</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>   - Incomplete application (blank pages)</p>
<p>   - No economic analysis</p>
<p>   - No environmental review</p>
<p>   - Community opposition</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Silent on Reynolds Doxxing:</strong> No public statement (found so far) condemning Reynolds' actions</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Silence = tacit approval of intimidation tactics</p>
<p>   - Failure to defend constituents' right to public comment</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignored Legal Concerns:</strong> Voted YES even though:</li>
</ul>
<p>   - Project may not legally qualify for LEDA (statute requires "new jobs")</p>
<p>   - Secret meetings and NDA likely violated Open Meetings Act</p>
<p>   - Incomplete application violated county procedures</p>

<h3>Political Vulnerabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Profile:</strong> Like Gameros, hasn't been publicly named/targeted (yet)</li>
<li><strong>Anonymity = Hiding:</strong> Can be framed as avoiding accountability</li>
<li><strong>If District 5 Includes Rural/Agricultural Areas:</strong> May be vulnerable to water usage argument</li>

<li>[ ] Past votes: Pro-development pattern?</li>

</ul>

<h3>Talking Points Against</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Commissioner Sanchez voted for $165 billion in corporate giveaways—twice"</li>
<li>"He approved a project with blank pages in the application"</li>
<li>"He stayed silent when Commissioner Reynolds doxxed residents"</li>
<li>"Who does he represent—us or corporate developers?"</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: THE YES VOTERS</h2>

<h3>Ranking by Vulnerability (Most to Least)</h3>

<strong>1. Shannon Reynolds (District 3)</strong> - MOST VULNERABLE
<ul>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> Doxxing incident = documented, indefensible misconduct</li>
<li><strong>Attack Strategy:</strong> Make her the face of corruption; demand resignation; pursue legal action</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Force resignation or removal; at minimum, make example to deter others</li>
</ul>

<strong>2. Christopher Schaljo Hernandez (District 1)</strong> - VULNERABLE AS CHAIR
<ul>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> Leadership position = higher accountability standard</li>
<li><strong>Attack Strategy:</strong> "The buck stops here" messaging; leadership failure frame</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Electoral defeat in next election; damage reputation</li>
</ul>

<strong>3. Gloria Gameros (District 2)</strong> - VULNERABLE IF DISTRICT AFFECTED
<ul>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> If District 2 includes Sunland Park/Santa Teresa, direct betrayal of constituents</li>
<li><strong>Attack Strategy:</strong> "She sold out her own neighbors" messaging; localized opposition</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Electoral defeat; make her defend vote publicly</li>
</ul>

<strong>4. Manuel A. Sanchez (District 5)</strong> - LEAST VULNERABLE (but still accountable)
<ul>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> Least information available; may represent less-affected district</li>
<li><strong>Attack Strategy:</strong> "He's hiding from accountability" frame; make him respond publicly</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Force into defensive position; weaken for next election</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Vulnerabilities (All Four)</h3>

<ul>

</ul>
<p>   - Sunland Park Mayor requested delay - ignored</p>
<p>   - Hundreds of residents opposed - ignored</p>

<li><strong>No Economic/Environmental Analysis</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>   - Approved $165B without knowing costs/benefits</p>
<p>   - Violated due diligence</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secret Process</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>   - NDA with developers</p>
<p>   - Private meetings months before public hearings</p>
<p>   - Open Meetings Act violations</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Legal Violations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>   - Project may not qualify for LEDA under state law</p>
<p>   - Ordinances subject to lawsuit</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Voted Twice</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>   - Second vote (Oct 14) came after growing opposition</p>
<p>   - Shows disregard for public input</p>
<p>   - Opportunity to correct mistake was rejected</p>
