<h2>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: THE FOUR YES VOTERS</h2>

<h3>Voting Cohesion</h3>
<strong>Pattern</strong>: All four voted identically on all three ordinances (Sept 19 x2, Oct 14)  
<strong>Significance</strong>: Suggests coordinated decision-making or shared pressure  
<strong>Question</strong>: Did they deliberate independently, or was the outcome predetermined?

<h3>Missing: The Dissent</h3>
<strong>Contrast</strong>: Commissioner Susana Chaparro voted NO on all three ordinances  
<strong>Implication</strong>: The project was NOT unanimously supported; Chaparro saw problems the others ignored or accepted  
<strong>Research needed</strong>: Interview or statement from Chaparro explaining her NO votes

<h3>Campaign Finance Cross-Reference</h3>
<strong>Research needed</strong>: Do the four YES voters share donors?
<ul>
<li>Common donor analysis</li>
<li>Industry sector analysis</li>
<li>PAC contributions</li>
</ul>

<strong>Method</strong>: 
<ul>
<li>Pull campaign finance reports for all four commissioners</li>
<li>Identify shared donors</li>
<li>Flag donors with connections to tech, development, or energy sectors</li>
<li>Analyze timing of donations relative to Project Jupiter timeline</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prior Voting Bloc Analysis</h3>
<strong>Research needed</strong>: Do these four typically vote together, or was Project Jupiter unusual?
<ul>
<li>Review 50+ prior major votes</li>
<li>Calculate voting alignment percentage</li>
<li>Identify: Is this a standing bloc, or did Project Jupiter create one?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>PRIORITY RESEARCH TASKS</h2>

<h3>High Priority (Smoking Guns)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign Finance</strong>: Search for donations from BorderPlex, affiliates, tech industry, energy sector</li>

<li><strong>Prior Voting Records</strong>: Pull voting history on comparable large-scale projects for all four</li>
<li><strong>NDA Signatories</strong>: Confirm which commissioners signed the NDA with developers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medium Priority (Context Building)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Affiliations</strong>: Secretary of State business entity searches for all four commissioners</li>
<li><strong>Public Statements Archive</strong>: Media mentions, commission video archives, press releases</li>
<li><strong>Economic Development Boards</strong>: Membership in orgs that benefit from Project Jupiter</li>
<li><strong>Legal Disclosures</strong>: Any required conflict of interest disclosures filed with county</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low Priority (Background)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Educational Background</strong>: Relevant to understanding technical project claims?</li>
<li><strong>Community Ties</strong>: Chamber memberships, civic organization roles</li>
<li><strong>Electoral History</strong>: Margin of victory in past elections (vulnerability analysis)</li>
</ul>

<h2>NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR PUBLIC USE</h2>

<h3>The Four Who Voted Away Billions</h3>
<p>"Four county commissioners—Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez, Gloria Gameros, Shannon Reynolds, and Manuel A. Sanchez—voted to give BorderPlex Digital $165 billion in tax breaks. They did so without an economic impact study, without a water impact analysis, and based on an application with blank pages. One of them—Shannon Reynolds—doxxed residents who opposed the project. These are the facts. These are the names. Hold them accountable."</p>

<h3>The Questions That Deserve Answers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who benefits from this project?</li>
<li>Who paid for their campaigns?</li>
<li>Why did they rush the vote?</li>
<li>What are they hiding?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Document Control</strong>: Profiles based on public voting records. Campaign finance, business affiliations, and detailed voting history require additional public records requests.
