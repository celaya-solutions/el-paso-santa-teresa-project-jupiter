# PROJECT JUPITER ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT
## The $165 Billion Question: Who Decided, What They Promised, and Why It Matters

**Evidence-Grade Public Report**  
**Doña Ana County, New Mexico**  
**Published**: January 22, 2026  
**Status**: FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

On September 19, 2025, four Doña Ana County Commissioners voted to approve the largest Industrial Revenue Bond in New Mexico history: **$165 billion** in tax breaks for Project Jupiter, a data center development proposed by BorderPlex Digital Assets LLC.

The vote was **4-1**. The same four commissioners voted YES on three separate ordinances over four weeks, giving away:
- $165 billion in IRB authorization (100% property tax abatement for 30 years)
- $50 million in GRT tax share (LEDA incentive)
- $4.5 million in reduced permit fees

**In exchange**, the county receives:
- A fixed $12 million/year "PILOT" payment (far less than actual property tax value)
- Promises of 750 jobs, 2,500 construction jobs, and $50 billion investment
- Commitments on water usage, local hiring, and environmental standards

**The problem**: Many of those promises are **not legally enforceable**. The decision process was **closed to the public** until 2 days before the vote. The IRB application allegedly had **"blank and missing pages."** No economic impact analysis. No water study. No environmental review completed.

This report documents:
- **Who voted** and why they're legally, politically, and administratively accountable
- **What contradictions exist** between promises and enforceability  
- **How the decision was made** in private, with minimal public input
- **What you can do** to demand accountability

**Every claim in this report is backed by primary sources**: legal documents, court filings, government records, and news coverage. We don't speculate. We document.

## PART I: THE ACTORS

### The Four Commissioners Who Voted YES

On September 19, 2025, these four commissioners voted to approve Ordinances 367-2025 and 368-2025. On October 14, 2025, they voted YES again on Ordinance 369-2025.

**4-1 voting record**:
1. **Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez** - YES, YES, YES
2. **Gloria Gameros** - YES, YES, YES
3. **Shannon Reynolds** - YES, YES, YES (also doxxed residents who opposed project)
4. **Manuel A. Sanchez** - YES, YES, YES

**The dissent**:
- **Susana Chaparro** - NO, NO, NO (only commissioner to oppose all three ordinances)

**Sources**: County voting records; PROJECT_JUPITER_ACCOUNTABILITY_MATRIX.csv rows VOTE-0041 through VOTE-0044

---

### The Governor Who Committed First

Seven months before the county voted, **New Mexico's Governor** signed a Memorandum of Understanding with BorderPlex Digital on **February 25, 2025**.

That state MOU committed New Mexico to:
- Classify natural gas as a **"zero carbon resource"** (scientifically false, legally dubious)
- **Subsidize brackish water drilling costs** with public funds
- **Fast-track environmental permits** and water rights transfers
- Support the project through LEDA and other state incentives

The state committed **before the county**, **before the public**, and **before any environmental review**.

**Source**: State MOU dated 2025-02-25, signed by Governor

---

### The Developer: BorderPlex Digital Assets LLC

**BorderPlex Digital Assets LLC** is the primary developer. The project involves multiple subsidiary entities:
- Yucca Growth Infrastructure, LLC (Series 2025A lease)
- Red Chiles [A/B/C/D], LLC (Series 2025B lease)
- Green Chile Ventures LLC (Series 2025B lease)
- [Series 2025C entities]

**CEO**: Lanham Napier (testified to NM legislature Aug 19, 2025)

**Alleged connection**: News reports suggest ties to OpenAI's $500 billion "Stargate" AI initiative, but this remains unconfirmed by official sources.

**Sources**: County MOU; Series 2025A/B lease documents; news coverage

---

### The Opposition: Community Groups and Legal Challengers

**Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County** organized protests, filed a lawsuit on October 17, 2025 (Case D-307-CV-2025-02766), and mobilized community members to attend commission meetings.

**New Mexico Environmental Law Center (NMELC)** provided legal support, filed formal complaints (including Commissioner Reynolds' doxxing incident), and advocated with state regulatory agencies.

**Individual plaintiffs**: José Saldaña Jr., Vivian Fuller

**Community activists**: Daisy Maldonado (Empower NM) and dozens of residents who spoke at meetings with signs reading **"You Can't Drink Data."**

**Sources**: Legal complaint filed Oct 17, 2025; NMELC letters and press releases; news coverage

## PART II: THE PROMISES VS. REALITY

### What They Promised

| Promise | Source | Enforceability |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| 750 full-time jobs, 50 part-time jobs, 2,500 construction jobs | County MOU Section 2.3, 2.4 | **Weak**: "Best efforts" local hiring (Series 2025B Lease §4.18); PILOT increase mechanism if job targets missed (§4.20), but unclear triggers |
| Salaries $75,000-$100,000 | Series 2025B Lease Recitals P14 | **Recital only** (not binding covenant) |
| Closed-loop cooling, avg 20k gpd, peak 60k gpd water use | Series 2025B Lease Recitals P13 | **Recital only**; no monitoring mechanism or penalty disclosed |
| $50 billion initial investment, up to $165 billion over 30 years | County MOU Section 2.1 | **MOU Section 5.1 states MOU creates "no legal rights or obligations"** except Appendix B contributions |
| $12 million/year PILOT payment | County MOU Section 3.6; Lease agreements | **Enforceable** (contractual obligation) |
| $50 million GRT share (LEDA) for county projects | LEDA PPA dated 2025-09-17 | **Enforceable**, but only for "eligible project costs" developer approves (PPA §3.5) |
| $6.9 million in community contributions (workforce, Boys & Girls Club, desalination, etc.) | County MOU Appendix B | **Enforceable** only after MOU execution and ordinance approvals (MOU §5.2) |
| Microgrid "will not impact existing customers' power reliability or costs" | County MOU Section 3.4.4 | **No study disclosed**; claim unverified |
| Net zero carbon by 2045 per HB93 | County MOU Section 3.4.4 | **State law requirement**, but Governor's MOU claims natural gas = "zero carbon" (contradiction) |

### The Contradictions

**15 documented contradictions** between:
- Public promises vs. legal enforceability (MOU §5.1 disclaims legal obligations)
- State MOU (natural gas = zero carbon) vs. County MOU (HB93 net zero requirement)
- Initial documents (missing water caps) vs. updated documents (water caps added)
- County counsel's advice (jobs/revenue not required in application) vs. lease commitments (specific job numbers)
- Environmental review timeline (incomplete, 6 months away) vs. construction schedule (Q4 2025 start)
- Open Meetings Act requirements vs. actual process (NDA, private meetings, 2-day document release)

## PART III: THE DECISION PROCESS

### Timeline: From Secret Meetings to Rubber-Stamp Vote

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Early 2025** | County officials sign NDA with BorderPlex; private meetings held (months before public hearings) |
| **Feb 25, 2025** | Governor signs State MOU (7 months before county vote) |
| **Aug 19, 2025** | Community protests at Legislative Finance Committee; "You Can't Drink Data" |
| **Sept 5, 2025** | Commissioner Shannon Reynolds doxxes residents who opposed project on Facebook |
| **Sept 8, 2025** | NMELC files formal complaint about doxxing |
| **Sept 17, 2025** | Documents released to public (2 days before vote) |
| **Sept 19, 2025** | Public hearing and vote (4-1 approval of IRB and LEDA GRT ordinances) |
| **Oct 14, 2025** | Second vote (4-1 approval of LEDA permit fee ordinance) |
| **Oct 17, 2025** | Lawsuit filed challenging all three ordinances |

### Open Meetings Act Violations Alleged

New Mexico's Open Meetings Act (NMSA § 10-15-1) requires:
- Public business conducted in open meetings
- Reasonable advance notice
- Opportunity for public review of materials

**What happened instead**:
- NDA signed in early 2025 (closed-door negotiations)
- Private meetings held for months
- Final documents released Sept 17, just 2 days before Sept 19 vote
- Mayor of Sunland Park said he was "finding out information the same time as press releases"
- IPRA requests for public records delayed or obstructed

**Legal consequence**: Violations of the Open Meetings Act are **criminal misdemeanors** (NMSA § 10-15-3). Actions taken in violation may be **voidable**.

**Source**: Legal complaint; news coverage; Amended Motion for Stay

---

### The Incomplete Application

The legal complaint filed October 17, 2025, alleges the IRB application contained **"blank and missing pages"** and lacked critical information required by statute.

New Mexico law (NMSA § 3-32-6) requires IRB applications to include financial projections, job creation data, and economic benefit analysis.

County Counsel told commissioners that jobs and revenue projections weren't required to be "specified in the application." But if the information wasn't in the application, **how did commissioners verify the project's claims**?

The county approved **$165 billion**—the largest IRB in state history—without complete information.

**Source**: Petition for Writ of Certiorari, filed Oct 17, 2025; Amended Motion for Stay

---

## PART IV: THE MISSING ANALYSES

### No Economic Impact Study

**What's missing**: Independent analysis comparing 30 years of property tax revenue (without abatement) to $12 million/year PILOT payment.

**Why it matters**: Property taxes on a $50 billion (potentially $165 billion) project would be worth **billions** over 30 years. The county settled for $360 million ($12M x 30 years). Who got the better deal?

**Source**: Absence documented in news coverage (KFOX14, Sept 19, 2025); PROJECT_JUPITER_ACCOUNTABILITY_MATRIX.csv row ISSUE-0030

---

### No Water Impact Study

**What's missing**: Hydrological analysis of project's impact on Mesilla Basin aquifer.

**Why it matters**: The basin is already water-stressed. Project plans to use up to 60,000 gallons/day (peak), with no disclosed monitoring or enforcement mechanism.

The state committed to **subsidize brackish water drilling** (State MOU lines 16-22), using public funds for private water use—but where's the public benefit analysis?

**Source**: Absence documented in PROJECT_JUPITER_ACCOUNTABILITY_MATRIX.csv row ISSUE-0033; no aquifer study released by county

---

### No Environmental Review Completed

**What's missing**: Environmental assessment incomplete as of November 4, 2025 (expected within 6 months).

**Why it matters**: Construction is scheduled for Q4 2025. The county approved permits before environmental review was complete.

**Contradiction**: Environmental safeguards require review **before** construction, not during.

**Source**: Amended Motion for Stay (environmental assessment status letter); County MOU Section 2.2 (construction timeline)

---

### No Grid Impact Study

**What's missing**: Load analysis and grid interconnection study for Project Jupiter's microgrid.

**Why it matters**: The MOU claims the microgrid "will not impact existing customers' power reliability or costs"—but based on what analysis?

**Source**: County MOU Section 3.4.4 (claim); no supporting study disclosed

---

## PART V: ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK

### Legal Exposure

**County Commissioners (4 who voted YES)**:
- Open Meetings Act violations (criminal misdemeanors)
- Ultra vires acts (exceeded statutory authority)
- Breach of fiduciary duty (approved incomplete application, no economic analysis)

**Governor's Office**:
- Misrepresentation of environmental law (natural gas as "zero carbon")
- Unauthorized commitments of public funds (water subsidies without legislative appropriation)
- Regulatory fast-tracking (circumventing environmental review)

**BorderPlex Digital Assets LLC**:
- Fraudulent inducement (if material representations prove false)
- Environmental violations (if construction proceeds without permits)
- Contract defaults (if job targets, water caps, or PILOT payments not met)

**Full accountability map with enforcement mechanisms**: See `accountability_map.md`

---

### Political Accountability

**Electoral targets**:
- Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez
- Gloria Gameros
- Shannon Reynolds (additional ethics liability for doxxing incident)
- Manuel A. Sanchez

**Recall requirements**: Signatures from 33.3% of registered voters

**Next elections**: [Research needed: When are these seats up for election?]

---

### Administrative Responsibility

**County Economic Development Department**: Failed to prepare economic impact analysis; accepted incomplete IRB application

**County Planning/Permitting**: Approved construction schedule before environmental review complete

**NM Environment Department**: Pre-committed to expedited permits in State MOU (regulatory capture concern)

**NM State Engineer**: Pre-committed to approve water rights transfers (undermines independent review)

## PART VIII: KEY FINDINGS

### Finding 1: The Decision Was Made in Private
NDA, private meetings, and 2-day document release violated the spirit—and likely the letter—of New Mexico's Open Meetings Act.

### Finding 2: The State Pre-Empted Local Control
Governor's Feb 25 MOU committed New Mexico 7 months before county vote, creating political pressure on commissioners.

### Finding 3: The Application Was Incomplete
Legal complaint alleges "blank and missing pages" in IRB application. County approved $165 billion without complete information.

### Finding 4: Key Promises Are Unenforceable
MOU Section 5.1 disclaims legal obligations for most commitments (jobs, investment, environmental claims). Only Appendix B contributions are binding.

### Finding 5: Critical Analyses Were Absent
No economic impact study. No water impact study. No completed environmental review. Commissioners voted blind.

### Finding 6: Natural Gas Is Not Zero Carbon
State MOU's claim that natural gas qualifies as "zero carbon" contradicts science, state law (HB93), and basic chemistry.

### Finding 7: A 4-1 Voting Bloc Controlled the Outcome
Four commissioners voted identically three times. Susana Chaparro stood alone in opposition.

### Finding 8: Retaliation Against Opposition Occurred
Commissioner Reynolds doxxed residents who opposed the project, then voted YES. Intimidation + support = evidence of personal stake or external pressure.

### Finding 9: Documents Changed After Initial Release
Water caps and $6.9M contributions reportedly missing from early documents, added later. Version control failure or deliberate withholding.

### Finding 10: The Public Was Excluded
Mayor of Sunland Park (adjacent municipality) excluded. Community members given 2 days to review documents. IPRA requests delayed or obstructed.

## CONCLUSION

Four county commissioners gave away billions in tax revenue for promises that may not be legally enforceable.

They did so in private, with minimal public input, and without the economic, water, and environmental analyses the community deserves.

One commissioner doxxed residents who opposed the project.

The largest IRB in New Mexico history was approved based on an allegedly incomplete application.

**These are the facts. These are the names. This is what happened.**

The question now is: **What are you going to do about it?**
