## Talking Points for Community Spokespeople

**Purpose:** Quick reference guide for interviews, public hearings, and community presentations  
**Prepared:** January 22, 2026

---

## OPENING STATEMENT (30 seconds)

"Project Jupiter is a $165 billion data center that threatens the health and safety of our community. We already lack safe drinking water - our water has arsenic contamination. County Commissioners approved this project in secret meetings based on incomplete applications with blank pages. We filed a lawsuit because our community's health is in danger. Water is life. We cannot survive without it."

---

## KEY MESSAGES (Memorize These 5)

### 1. WATER CRISIS
**Message:** "We already lack safe drinking water. Project Jupiter will make it worse."

**Supporting Facts:**

> — Mayor Javier Perea, Sunland Park

---

### 4. ENVIRONMENTAL HARM

## RESPONDING TO COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: "Won't this bring jobs to the area?"

**A:** "That's what they claim, but where's the proof? There's no economic analysis showing what jobs, how many, or what they pay. Meanwhile, we KNOW it will harm our water supply, pollute our air, and drain taxpayer dollars through tax breaks. We're a 91% Hispanic, 52% low-income community already struggling. This project offers no guaranteed benefits but certain harms."

**Key Point:** Demand documentation of benefits, emphasize documented harms

---

### Q: "Isn't economic development important?"

**A:** "Economic development should benefit our community, not harm it. Real development would fix our contaminated water, invest in local infrastructure, and create jobs for residents. Project Jupiter does none of that. It's $165 billion in tax breaks for outside corporations while our families drink arsenic-contaminated water. That's not development - that's exploitation."

**Key Point:** Contrast Project Jupiter with real community needs

---

### Q: "What about the legal process? Shouldn't we let it play out?"

**A:** "That's exactly what we're doing - we filed a lawsuit on October 17, 2025 because the approval was illegal. But the legal process takes time. Meanwhile, we need to stop construction from starting. Once they break ground, the damage is done. We're asking officials, media, and the public to stand with us NOW to prevent irreversible harm to our community."

**Key Point:** Legal process is happening, but urgency requires immediate action

---

### Q: "Don't we need AI and data centers for the future?"

**A:** "Maybe, but not at the cost of our community's health and survival. Build data centers where there's adequate water, where communities consent, where environmental protections are in place. Don't sacrifice low-income Hispanic communities that already lack safe water. Environmental justice means not dumping problems on vulnerable populations."

**Key Point:** Not opposed to data centers everywhere, opposed to this one here

---

### Q: "What do you want officials/the public to do?"

**A:** "We need three things:
1. **Support our lawsuit** - this approval was illegal and must be overturned
2. **Demand transparency** - county officials must release all documents and stop secret dealings
3. **Protect our water** - no project should move forward until our existing water crisis is solved"

**Key Point:** Clear, actionable demands

---

## EMOTIONAL APPEALS (Use Sparingly, Authentically)

### For Community Members:
"I'm a mother/father. I worry every day about the water my children drink. It already has arsenic. Now they want to take more water for a data center? How do I explain to my kids that their health matters less than corporate profits?"

### For Residents:
"My family has lived here for generations. We've built our lives here. We've always been told we don't matter, that progress requires sacrifice - but it's always OUR sacrifice. When is our community worth protecting?"

### For Advocates:
"This is environmental racism. Plain and simple. They chose our community because we're Hispanic, low-income, and they think we don't have power. But we do have power. We have our voices, our votes, and our legal rights. And we're fighting back."

---

## PIVOTING BACK TO KEY MESSAGES

If interview goes off-track, use these phrases to pivot back:

- "That's an interesting point, but what's most important is..."
- "Let me be clear about what's at stake here..."
- "The real issue is..."
- "Here's what community members need to understand..."
- "What I want people to remember is..."

**Always pivot to:** Water crisis, illegal approval, or community harm

---

## SOUND BITES (Great for Media)

**Choose the ones that feel authentic to you:**

1. "Water is life. Without safe water, there is no community."

2. "They approved $165 billion in tax breaks based on an application with blank pages."

3. "We're not lab rats for corporate experiments. We're families trying to survive."

4. "Our water already has arsenic. Project Jupiter will make a bad situation deadly."

5. "County officials made secret deals and kept us in the dark - that's not how democracy works."

6. "They chose our community because we're Hispanic and low-income. That's environmental racism."

7. "We filed a lawsuit because the law matters. Community health matters. Justice matters."

8. "When a Commissioner exposes residents' home addresses for speaking out, that's intimidation - and it's wrong."

9. "No economic analysis. No environmental study. No community consent. That's how they approved $165 billion."

10. "We're not anti-development. We're pro-survival."

---

## BODY LANGUAGE & DELIVERY TIPS

### DO:
- Speak calmly and clearly - emotion is powerful, but clarity is essential
- Make eye contact (with interviewer or audience)
- Use pauses for emphasis
- Reference personal experience ("In my neighborhood...", "My family...")
- Show documents if possible (hold up EPA report, photos of contaminated water)

### DON'T:
- Yell or appear angry (righteous anger is OK, but controlled)
- Use insider jargon or technical terms without explanation
- Speak too fast - nerves make us rush
- Apologize for taking up time or space
- Let yourself be interrupted without finishing your point

---

## HANDLING HOSTILE QUESTIONS

### If accused of "blocking progress":
"Real progress means clean water, healthy communities, and inclusive decision-making. Project Jupiter offers none of that. We're fighting FOR real progress."

### If accused of "not understanding economics":
"I understand that $165 billion in tax breaks leaves less money for schools, roads, and public services. I understand that corporations profit while our families pay higher water and electricity bills. That's the economics that matters to us."

### If accused of "being anti-business":
"We're not anti-business. Many of us ARE business owners. We're anti-corruption, anti-secrecy, and anti-exploitation. Businesses should operate legally, transparently, and with community consent."

### If told "you're not experts":
"We're experts on our own community. We're experts on what it's like to drink contaminated water. We're experts on being ignored by people in power. And we hired legal experts - the New Mexico Environmental Law Center - to represent us."

## CONNECTING TO BROADER MOVEMENTS

### Link to other struggles:
- "This is like Flint, Michigan - government ignoring contaminated water"
- "This is environmental justice - standing up to corporate power"
- "This is about democracy - community voices must be heard"
- "This is about dignity - we deserve safe water and clean air"

### Link to values:
- **Family:** "Every parent wants safe water for their children"
- **Fairness:** "The rules should apply to everyone, including corporations"
- **Faith:** "We're called to protect the vulnerable and care for creation"
- **Patriotism:** "American values include justice, transparency, and equal protection"

## ENDING STATEMENTS (30-60 seconds)

### Version 1 (Hopeful):
"We have faith in the legal system. We have faith in our community. We have faith that when people learn the truth about Project Jupiter, they'll stand with us. This is David vs. Goliath, but David won. We're not giving up. We're fighting for our families, our health, and our future."

### Version 2 (Urgent):
"Every day that passes, Project Jupiter gets closer to breaking ground. Once construction starts, it's too late. We need support NOW. Call your elected officials. Share our story. Stand with us. Our community's survival depends on people acting TODAY."

### Version 3 (Moral):
"History will judge how we responded to this moment. Will we stand by while a vulnerable community is exploited? Or will we choose justice? We're asking everyone to choose justice. Choose clean water. Choose community health. Choose to stand with Santa Teresa and Sunland Park."
